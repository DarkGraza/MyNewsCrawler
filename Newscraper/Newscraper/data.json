From crisp blazers, knit vests and jumpers to workwear inspired jackets, easy trousers and camp collar shirts, most showcases nodded in favour of masculine elegance inculcating ergonomic elements. ;Clinical whites, sandy beiges, olive greens, dark blue and black besides a hint of metallic hues appeared on the runways of brands like Hermès, Dior Men, Ami and Officine Générale with an interplay of layering and accentuated by kicky accessories. Hermès menswear show, on the other hand, was a delightful dialogue on summer layering, from the chore jackets thrown nonchalantly on the camp collar shirts to the printed co-ord sets. Dior Men by Kim Jones, meanwhile, saw an artistic alliance with ceramicist Hylton Nel, which resulted in studded outlines, artistically peppered on footwear and tailoring. ;Here are some key trends that emerged:Chore jackets galoreWorkwear-inspired blazers and jackets, lightweight multi-pocketed parkas in technical fabrics, (which were also seen at Milan earlier) made their presence felt on the Parisian runway. It’s all about the patch pockets this season as seen on chore jackets at Hermès, Dior Men and Officine Générale. ;The classic tailored suit may not be completely out of fashion but an open collar workwear jacket and languid trousers seem to be growing popular. Robert Pattinson at Dior Men’s show also showed up in a Nehru collar open jacket worn with a pair of matching trousers. ;Also read: Milan Fashion Week: Classic tailoring gets a trendy twist﻿Surrealist forces come into playTrompe-l’œil prints and embroideries, which trick the eye and beg for another look, made their presence felt like never before. For instance, at Comme des Garçons Homme Plus, designer Rei Kawakubo sent out jackets embossed with imagery of layers of unbuttoned shirts and more jackets. Ditto at Acne Studios, where jeans were printed with keychains that appeared as if they were dangling from the waist. At Ottolinger, a bodysuit was printed with a shirt, a tie, and a blazer. ;Double breasted tailoring is here to stay as well. Louis Vuitton’s show saw slender double-breasted coats and suits with the straight or flared sculpting of trousers. ;The classic double breasted suit did appear on many runways but in an open button, easy breezy and relaxed format, seen at Junya Watanabe, Hed Mayner and Amiri. Especially worth mentioning are the DB upcycled jackets at Junya Watanabe. Amiri’s showcase underscored the ease and freedom imparted by relaxed tailoring. The brand’s signature double breasted jacket was half lined and lent a generously proportioned dropped peak lapel. It was soft tailoring at its best. ;Heritage revivalThrough the season’s travel-centric magnifying glass, the Louis Vuitton collection infused the emblems of the maison with sensorial and textural impact. Inspired by the surfaces of skin, the embossed branded Monogram appeared on tonal constructions in ready-to-wear. Evoking animal skin, the Damoflage, the new classic spliced from Damier and camouflage, was adapted into a \"Snake-o-Flage: motif inspired by the graphics of python and realised in textiles. At Dior Men, several looks offered a thoughtful homage to Dior archive womenswear designs: pleated trousers that evolved into wrap closures. ;Print CharmingFrom horse and swirling harness prints seen at Hermès to the floral and botanical prints at Kenzo, it was a season rich in luscious motifs. There were plenty of ikat and folklore prints spotted at Isabel Marant as well.Manish Mishra is a Delhi-based writer and content creator.Also read: Why is menswear so boring on the red carpet?", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T16:29:08+05:30"},

The brokerage has reiterated its 'BUY' call on the private sector lender with a target price of  ₹1,350 (premised on 2.5x FY26E ABV). This indicates an over 15 percent potential upside.The stock hit its record high of  ₹1,199.35 and its market cap crossed $100 billion in intra-day deals today. The stock has now risen over 33 percent from its 52-week low of  ₹898.85, hit on October 26, 2023.\"While we estimate margins to remain range-bound in the near term, the operating leverage is emerging as a lever to support earnings growth. The bank is witnessing healthy deposit inflow, while a benign CD ratio (lowest among large private banks) places it well to focus on profitable growth. The asset quality outlook remains robust as the bank maintains strong PCR and a high contingency buffer (1.1% of loans),\" explained the brokerage. It estimates ICICI Bank will deliver a PPoP/PAT CAGR of 16.7 percent/13.7 percent over FY24-26E, leading to RoA/RoE of 2.2 percent/17.7 percent.ICICI Bank has already gained almost 29 percent in the last 1 year and 20 percent in 2024 YTD. The stock has given positive returns in 5 of the 6 months so far this year. It rose 6.7 percent in June to date after a 2.5 percent fall in May. But, it was in the green for the first 4 months of 2024. Meanwhile, in the long term - 3 years - as well, the stock has surged over 84 percent.Investment RationaleLoan growth to remain robust: The brokerage noted that ICICI Bank is consistently outpacing system credit growth, driven by higher growth in retail and SME segments, while wholesale growth remains modest. The bank reported a 17 percent CAGR in loans over FY22-24, with a diversified and granular portfolio. Data analytics-driven processes for onboarding, credit assessment, and customer monitoring support this growth. Unsecured loans (credit cards + personal loans) now make up 14 percent of the portfolio, mainly extended to existing, salaried customers. Moving forward, the bank will continue to focus on risk-calibrated growth in SME, business banking, and retail while tightening underwriting in unsecured lending to maintain portfolio quality, said the brokerage.Liability momentum healthy: ICICI Bank delivered industry-leading deposit growth of 20 percent in FY24. As per MOSL, strategic initiatives in digital banking and branch network expansion are set to sustain this momentum. It added that continuous improvements in digital platforms and simplified processes have enhanced customer experience. The bank has launched several digital innovations, such as iLens, Insta Export Packing Credit, InstaBIZ, and Merchant Stack, offering customised solutions, data-driven cross-sell and up-sell, and value-added features. This 360-degree customer-centric approach is boosting customer acquisition and engagement levels, highlighted the brokerage.NIMs to remain range-bound in the near term: MOSL pointed out that ICICI Bank is focused on strengthening its retail deposit base, despite a moderation in the CASA mix to 42.2 percent in FY24 (39 percent on average) due to a higher rate differential. The management aims to maintain a stable deposit profile to control funding costs. With a conservative Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 82.3 percent on its domestic book, the bank is well-positioned for loan growth, it mentioned. MOSL further observed that its margins have decreased by 50 basis points to 4.4 percent over the past year, but the pace of compression slowed to a 3 basis point decline in 4QFY24. The bank expects margins to remain range-bound with a slight downside bias due to elevated term deposit rates and residual repricing, it said.ICICI Bank’s transformation under competent management: Under Mr. Bakhshi's leadership, ICICI Bank has transformed its HR policies, shifting focus from individual to team performance. Despite industry-wide attrition challenges, the bank has built a strong leadership bench and emphasises structured processes over individual star performers. This \"One Bank, One Team\" approach has driven collective efforts towards organisational goals, delivering consistently strong results. The management's focus on a cohesive culture supports sustainable and profitable growth, reinforcing ICICI Bank's position as a resilient and successful institution in the banking sector, stated MOSL.Asset quality remains robust: ICICI Bank has significantly improved its asset quality, achieving a best-in-class PCR of 81 percent and holding contingent provisions of  ₹13,100 crore (1.1 percent of loans), ensuring low credit costs, informed MOSL. Enhanced underwriting through analytics and controlled restructuring has also kept slippages in check. It further added that the lender has refined credit filters and increased pricing for new personal loans as a risk measure, though no adverse trends are seen in the unsecured portfolio. Investments in technology and analytics have helped maintain control over slippages. GNPA/NNPA ratios are projected to moderate to 2.17 percent/0.28 percent by FY26E, with credit costs rising to 0.6 percent by FY26E, predicted MOSL.Fee growth steady; operating leverage emerging as a key lever: ICICI Bank achieved a 16 percent growth in core fees in FY24, driven by initiatives in retail, SME, and business banking, which contributed 78 percent of overall fees. The bank's focus on transaction banking, forex services, and derivatives, along with increased market share in credit cards, bolstered fee income. Data analytics enhanced digital transactions and a corporate portfolio recovery is expected to spur further fee growth. Despite a 22 percent average YoY growth in opex over the past three years, the C/I ratio remains stable at 40 percent. The bank aims for 15 percent YoY growth in opex over FY24-26E, leveraging technology to improve productivity, noted MOSL.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

Do you know apart from waking up till late, what else I don’t like about this T20 World Cup? It’s the Term Plan advertisement aired on TV between overs during every match.The question asked is how much minimum term insurance coverage you need. And pat comes the reply: “10 times your annual earnings.” If you check on YouTube, many influencers suggest a minimum cover of 15-20 times annual income.“Make things as simple as possible, but no simpler” is a quote often attributed to Albert Einstein. It's often used to encourage making a subject easy to understand, but not so easy that it becomes meaningless. These advertisements are doing the same thing. They are simplifying it so much that it loses its significance.So, what should determine your term insurance cover? I would say, broadly three things: financial situation, family expenses, and life goals. However, you should also factor in inflation, besides considering large future expenses and investments such as your child's education and parents' healthcare needs.If you are a perfectionist, you may use the human life value calculator that does this calculation in a much more organized and practical way.&nbsp;However, for most people who are not that sophisticated, there should ideally be a good balance between how much you can afford and how much you need.We should avoid extremes on both ends. Just because your income is low, you should not ignore or under-cover for term plan. Similarly, just because your income is very high, you should not over-cover for a term plan.&nbsp;Let me share an example to prove my point. If you are a boot-strapped startup founder, there is a high probability that you are drawing either no or a meager salary from your business. If you draw only  ₹50,000 per month ( ₹6 lakh a year), do you think 10 times of that (60 lakh) is enough to secure your family? Probably not. So, you may have to go beyond that 10x rule here.&nbsp;On the other hand, if you are the CEO of the highest paying AMC and get a  ₹50 crore-plus annual salary, should you compulsorily take a term plan coverage of  ₹500 crore?To sum up, I would say, the following 5 simple rules can be a good guide:A term plan is a must for the income earner of a family.Decide your coverage amount based on your financial situation, family expenses and future goals.&nbsp;Never forget to factor in the impact of inflation on your family's needs.Don’t go to the extreme. Keep a balance between what you can afford and what you need.Start as early as possible.The sixth, and probably the most important rule, is that don’t fall for oversimplified calculation.&nbsp;Ankit Kanodia is founder of Smart Sync Services, a Sebi-registered investment advisory firm.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T16:42:54+05:30"},

Since June 2022, each 10% correction in the Nifty has been followed by a 20% rally over the subsequent six months.

In December 1990, an independence referendum was conducted, resulting in 94.8% of votes supporting sovereignty.On Statehood Day, the white, blue, and red national flag is prominently displayed at Ljubljana Castle, where independence was initially declared.The tricolour stripes signify a unified Slovenia, and the coat of arms reflects the country’s rich landscape. Many people participate in celebratory gatherings in the capital, while others take advantage of the occasion to engage in outdoor activities such as hiking or enjoying the seaside.On June 10, Google Doodle also celebrated Portugal Day, aka Dia de Portugal, aka de Camões e das Comunidades Portuguesas in Portuguese. Portugal’s national holiday remembers the legendary poet Luis de Camões. His poem Os Lusíadas (The Lusiads), written in 1572, is considered Portugal’s national epic. The poem celebrates the country’s culture and its discoveries and explorations.The work also mentions Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama’s discovery of a sea route to India. The ten cantos of the poem are in ottava rima and total 1,102 stanzas.Every year, people in the country celebrate their shared culture and history on this day. Unlike other nations, Portugal’s celebration of this day is not limited to its capital city, but the central location of the celebration varies every year. The president chooses a city to hold the official festivities. This year, festivities will be held in Pedrógão Grande, Figueiró dos Vinhos, Castanheira de Pera, Leiria, and Coimbra.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T07:40:10+05:30"},

N. Balagopal sought a special package of  ₹24,000 crore from the Centre to address the state’s liquidity crunch. In his speech, a copy of which was shared with the press, he said the package could be scheduled over a period of two years from 2024-25.Balagopal said that in a federal set up, the fiscal consolidation path of a state doesn’t only depend on the state’s own efforts and expenditure, but it also depends heavily on the transfer of resources from the Centre and the distribution fiscal powers.Also Read: Centre likely to increase interest-free loans to statesThe minister said the state has taken all possible measures to enhance its own tax and non-tax revenue. “Despite these efforts, the state government is going through a very serious liquidity crunch,” he added.Liquidity problems ;Balagopal attributed the liquidity problems to a reduction in the state’s share in the Centre’s divisible pool of tax revenue over successive Finance Commission periods, goods and services tax (GST) rate cuts, cessation of GST compensation, tapering of revenue deficit grants from the Centre and restrictions on open market borrowings.“Kerala is of the view that this additional restriction on open market borrowing travels beyond the scope of the road map for fiscal consolidation laid down by the 15th Finance Commission and request that the Government of India may review them.”The minister added the state is currently borrowing much lower compared to the limits set for the state on account of changes introduced in the calculation of the borrowing ceiling such as inclusion of public account and the borrowings of state-owned enterprises, the minister said. “Hence, this policy has to be reversed.”Also Read: Sitharaman delivers a low-decibel, pitch-perfect interim budgetChhattisgarh finance minister O.

But under Part-1 allocation, which is not linked to reforms, the amount has been revised from  ₹1 trillion to  ₹55,000 crore, the minister said in a statement. ;Choudhary urged Sitharaman to maintain the allocation at  ₹1 trillion like previous years as it will support ongoing capital projects effectively.He suggested the remaining amount can be kept for state capital as reform-based incentives and for special projects. The ‘special assistance to states for capital investment’ scheme was launched in 2020-21 to help states after the pandemic.

Economists expect no change in the May personal consumption expenditures price index and a minimal 0.1% gain in the core measure that excludes food and energy, based on median projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists. ;  The report, due Friday, is also projected to show 2.6% annual advances in both the overall and core gauges. The expected increase in the core measure, which paints a better picture of underlying inflation, would remain the smallest since March 2021.  Since their last meeting, Fed officials have said that while they’re encouraged by the simmering down in other inflation data — including the consumer price index — they need to see months of such progress before lowering rates. At the same time, the labor market - the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate - is still plugging along, albeit in a lower gear. A healthy job market is providing policymakers some flexibility on the timing of interest-rate cuts.  The latest inflation numbers will be accompanied by personal spending figures that will inform on services outlays after recent retail sales data showed less of an appetite for merchandise. The median forecast calls for a slight acceleration in nominal personal consumption as well as income. ;  What Bloomberg Economics Says:  “We don’t think the slower inflation print will be enough to convince officials by the time of the July FOMC meeting that inflation is on a firm trajectory down to the Fed’s 2% target.”  —Estelle Ou, Stuart Paul and Eliza Winger, economists. For full analysis, click here  Among other data in the coming week are readings on June consumer confidence and reports on May contract signings for purchases of both new and previously-owned homes. In addition to the third estimate of first-quarter economic growth, the government will release figures on durable goods orders for May.  In Canada, central bank Governor Tiff Macklem is set to speak in Winnipeg, consumer price data for May are expected to show core inflation easing for a fifth month, and a gross domestic product release for April along with a flash estimate for May will also provide crucial insight.  Elsewhere, inflation numbers in three major euro-zone economies may also cheer officials, while central banks in Sweden and Mexico will probably keep rates on hold.  Click here for what happened in the past week and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.  Asia  Asia gets under way with the release of minutes from this month’s Bank of Japan policy board meeting. ;  The document takes on heightened interest after authorities pledged to cut bond buying, while also saying that investors will have to wait until late July before getting details about the scale of the reductions. Hints may emerge on Monday. ;  Elsewhere, Reserve Bank of Australia Assistant Governor Christopher Kent speaks on Wednesday and Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser a day later, with the focus falling on any fresh hints of hawkishness after the governor said the board considered a hike at its meeting this month. ;  They speak after data Wednesday are expected to show Australian inflation ticked higher in May. ;  Japan will see a leading indicator for national inflation trends with the release of the Tokyo CPI gauge for June. Bloomberg Economics expects inflation in the capital to have picked up to 2.1%, lifted by an increase in utility prices after the government cut energy subsidies. ;  Other nations publishing updates on prices include Malaysia, Singapore and Uzbekistan. ;  In other data, China’s industrial profits on Thursday may reflect the benefits of an official push for equipment upgrades, and trade statistics are due during the week in New Zealand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Hong Kong. ;  South Korea gets two indicators pointing to domestic demand with retail sales and consumer confidence. ; Europe, Middle East, Africa  The Riksbank decision on Thursday will be a highlight, with Swedish officials widely expected by economists to pause their easing cycle after an initial rate cut last month — presaging a similar move anticipated for the European Central Bank to stay on hold in July.  With policymakers becoming more confident that Sweden is closer to taming inflation, they may ratify a path of two more reductions this year to bolster an economy that’s forecast by European Union officials to post one of the weakest expansions in the whole bloc.  Here’s a quick look at other central bank decisions around the wider region: In the euro zone, inflation data in three of its four biggest economies will arrive toward the end of the week. The reports are expected to show slowing in France and Spain, with price growth staying weak in Italy. ;  Those numbers may offer encouragement to officials after last month’s setback, when inflation accelerated more than anticipated across the region. The ECB’s survey of consumer price expectations will also be released on Friday. ;  Other reports include Germany’s Ifo business confidence index on Monday, which is anticipated to show further gradual improvement in sentiment among companies in the region’s biggest economy.  Policymakers scheduled to speak include Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, whose economy is subject to intense investor scrutiny before upcoming legislative elections. Appearances by ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane and the German and Italian central bank heads are also on the calendar. ;  In the UK, meanwhile, Bank of England officials — whose June 20 decision moved closer toward a potential rate cut in August — will continue to avoid public communications ahead of the July 4 general election. Data there include the final GDP release for the first quarter on Friday, including current account numbers.  Turning to Africa, Zambia’s growth statistics for the first three months of 2024, due on Thursday, may reveal some of the impact from a devastating drought. The dry spell is expected to cut expansion to 2.5% this year from 5.2% in 2023. ;  The next day, Kenyan inflation for June will give a further indication of the impact flooding and heavy rains have had on food prices there. Latin America  Mexico’s central bank gets its last consumer price reading on Monday before Thursday’s monetary policy decision, and the data will likely leave Banco de Mexico thoroughly unimpressed. With inflation warming up again and drifting further above target, Banxico is all but certain to stay on hold at 11% for a second meeting.  The central bank is the focus in Brazil as it releases minutes of its June 18-19 monetary policy meeting on Tuesday as well as its quarterly inflation report on Thursday. Sandwiched between the two is the mid-month reading of the benchmark consumer price index.  Keeping the key rate at 10.5% came as no surprise, though the post-decision communique’s relatively mild tone raised a few eyebrows.  Argentina’s economy likely fell into a technical recession at the start of 2024, with deep quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year declines. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg see a 5.4% year-on-year plunge, the biggest decline since the pandemic.  While many of the region’s other big inflation targeting central banks are either sidelined or increasingly hawkish, Colombia’s BanRep is expected to cut by a half point to 11.25% — 200 basis points down from last year’s 13.25% peak — and is on a path to end 2024 at 8.5%. --With assistance from Brian Fowler, Robert Jameson, Laura Dhillon Kane, Piotr Skolimowski, Monique Vanek and Paul Wallace.

She highlighted the ‘Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment’, noting that while most loans are unrestricted, a portion remains conditional on states implementing citizen-centric reforms and specific capital projects across sectors.

The deficit stood at $23.78 billion in May, up 5.5% year-on-year and up 24.5% from April. ;Merchandise exports increased to $38.13 billion in May, up from $34.95 billion in May 2023 and $34.99 billion in April. ;Imports, however, saw a sharper rise, reaching $61.91 billion in May, up from $57.48 billion in May 2023 and $54.09 billion in the previous month.Why MSMEs are importantMSMEs are a key constituent of the Indian exports ecosystem, contributing about 45% to the country’s total exports, according to a Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) report. They also account for around 38% of India’s manufacturing output.MSMEs also contribute about 27% to India’s GDP and employ more than 110 million people, making it the largest employer after agriculture (about 148 million employed, according to GTRI).A NITI Aayog report on MSME exports released in March this year said: \"Exports represent an enormous and under-utilized opportunity for the MSME sector.

India’s recent inclusion in the JP Morgan bond index fund is expected to attract substantial interest from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in long-term sovereign green bonds. Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted FPIs to invest in these bonds via the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), further boosting market confidence,\" said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, managing partner at Rockfort Fincap Llp, a financial advisory firm.Last September, JP Morgan said it would add 23 Indian government bonds to its widely tracked emerging market debt index beginning 28 June 2024, while Bloomberg Index Services had in March said it would include 34 Indian government bonds in its Emerging Market Local Currency Index from 31 January next year.Interestingly, the government did not accept bids in the sovereign green bond auction of  ₹6,000 crore held on 31 May, despite receiving bids totalling  ₹ 12,677 crore.\"It is assumed that the government found the ‘greenium’  ;(premium for green bonds) unsatisfactory. Additionally, election-related spending restrictions played a role in this decision. Similar constraints led to the cancellation of treasury bill auctions during the election period,\" added Srinivasan.Cost advantageFor green bonds to support borrowing plans, they need to offer a cost advantage over conventional bonds, especially considering their eco-friendly label, said the second person mentioned above, who didn’t want to be named.\"It is prudent to raise money via the green bonds route, only if it provides an advantage over similar issues of conventional bonds. If conventional bonds yield 7%, green bonds should be at a discount and shouldn’t have more than 6.7%-6.8% yield to be feasible,\" the person said.The yield on the Indian 10-year government bond settled at 6.973% on 21 June.Also this | Centre announces infrastructure projects, farmer support as part of 100 day programmeThe 10-year yield has fallen to a near-one-year low due to the record surplus dividend transfer by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the government, sparking hopes of the Centre lowering its fiscal deficit and borrowing.A finance ministry spokesperson didn’t respond to emailed queries.Funds raised by selling green bonds can’t be utilised for projects related to fossil fuel extraction, production or distribution, or nuclear power.

Conversions are as per 23 June currency value. ;The domestic price of wheat in key mandis is in the range of  ₹ 26,980-27,100 per tonne and the minimum support price of wheat is  ₹ 2,275 per tonne, according to spot traders.As per data from the consumer affairs ministry, all-India average price of the staple grain on Sunday was  ₹31 a kg, a rise of 6.4% year-on-year and wholesale price was  ₹27,720 per tonne, an increase of 6.6% on year.Also this | Govt misses wheat procurement target for second consecutive year, procures 26.6 mt—28.7% lower than target“As per my understanding and discussions at the international grains council meeting last week in London, India might import a million or two tonnes of wheat to soften prices and keep a little extra for food security purposes.  ;Given the fact that wheat production estimates are at the same level as last year or a million or two less than that, it’s better that the government allows private trade to import a couple of million tonnes of wheat by lowering duty,” M.J. Khan, chairman of the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture said. ;“Last year production was significantly down by 3.8 million tonnes. Because of this, the government might take an extra cautious approach in terms of wheat. Buffer stocks are sufficient and above the reserve requirement; but to soften prices and as an extra precautionary measure, there’s a possibility of a couple of million tonnes of wheat being imported.”As for stock limits, the third official said, “The permitted limit of 3,000 tonnes for wholesalers, 10 tonnes for retailers, 10 tonnes for each outlet and 3,000 tonnes at all depots for big chain retailers, 70% of monthly installed capacity multiplied by the remaining months of the current financial year in the case of processors has been proposed.\"As per February stock limits, wholesalers were permitted to keep only 500 tonnes, retailers 5 tonnes, big chain retailers 5 tonnes for each outlet and 500 tonnes at all depots, processors 60% of monthly installed capacity multiplied by remaining months till April 2024.And this | Wheat procurement surpasses last year’s figures, hits 26.3 million tonnes\"Additionally, 2.5 million tonnes of OMSS (open market sale scheme) is initially likely from July or August as per emerging requirements,” the third official said.The Centre closed wheat procurement at 26.6 million tonnes against last year’s 26.2 million tonnes and the target of 31 million tonnes. After NFSA and other welfare schemes and buffer stock requirement, the government is estimated to have 8.2 million tonnes for OMSS. In the 2023-24 rabi season, the government released about 10.1 million tonnes of wheat under OMSS, the highest ever.The annual requirement of wheat for NFSA and other welfare schemes is 18.4 million tonnes and closing stock requirement as of 31 March 2025 is 15.7 million tonnes.All three measures are in the pipeline as prices of wheat generally tend to increase at the procurement season and peak in December-January.Queries sent on Thursday to the secretaries and spokesperson of the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution remained unanswered at press time.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-23T18:22:45+05:30"},

However, it solely focuses on centralized exams, leaving out malpractices in other forms of examinations, experts said.The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, came into effect on 21 June following a notification by the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions. ;Read | Government forms panel to improve NTA as NEET, UGC-NET controversies ragePunishable offences under the law include unauthorized access or leakage of question papers or answer keys, providing illicit assistance to candidates during exams, tampering with computer networks or resources, and manipulating documents related to merit lists or ranks. ;Both individuals and institutions could face imprisonment ranging from three to five years, coupled with fines of up to  ₹10 lakh. ;Legal experts acknowledged the need for such legislation and hailed it as the first of its kind in India to curb organized crime networks behind paper leaks and hold government bodies like the NTA accountable. ;However, they pointed to several shortcoming.One of them is the exclusion of state exams such as the UP police recruitment exam from its purview. This leaves it for states to come up with their own such laws.And this | Heartburn at coaching centres as NEET lands in court\"The Act has the authority to legislate on examination malpractices, specifically focusing on public examinations conducted by entities defined in the schedule of the Act or notified authorities. Currently, this includes examinations by seven bodies, such as the Union Public Service Commission and the Staff Selection Commission, falling under its purview. However, state-conducted examinations, where paper leaks are notably more prevalent, are not covered. It is crucial that states establish robust mechanisms to address and prevent unfair practices and fraud in their public examinations,\" said Angad Baxi, principal associate at JSA Advocates and Solicitors.Also this | How state-level school boards can promote educational equityAccording to Baxi, while the Act is meant to serve as a model law for states, it’s crucial to acknowledge that each state has unique job requirements. Not all states will be able to adopt identical model drafts. ;If a state opts not to enact a law, the only recourse available in case of paper leaks will be to follow the standard process of inquiry and investigation under general law. This poses a significant roadblock to implementing the law effectively at the grassroots level.The experts Mint spoke to also pointed out other loopholes such as the absence of fixed timelines for agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe malpractices, with no interim measures in place during the probe.\"The Act does not specify timelines for completing investigations once they are lodged,\" noted Gauhar Mirza, partner at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. ;Mirza added, \"Another significant issue is the absence of guidelines on interim measures. For instance, in the current NEET (UG) case being investigated by the CBI, counselling is ongoing without any pause. This raises concerns: if the CBI finds anomalies and the exam is cancelled, what happens to candidates who have already undergone counselling? ;Will it result in trained doctors who may not have cleared a fair competitive exam? These are critical questions needing immediate attention, and the law should address provisions for interim measures.\"Legal experts also highlighted loopholes such as the exemption of students from accountability under the law. This means that even if a student is found engaged in irregularities, they would not be punished under this law.According to Mirza, \"A first glance shows that the exemption clause that provides that the law does not apply to individuals who can prove that the offense occurred without their knowledge and that they tried their best to prevent it is an area which might be taken advantage of. The threshold of individuals has been kept very low.\"Advocate Charu Mathur, one of the petitioners’ lawyers against NTA in the Supreme Court, criticized the law as a quick-fix solution that fails to address the underlying issues. \"Will this make the Chairperson liable? They need to get to the bottom and identify the real culprits,\" remarked Mathur.\"This law only focuses on punishment, but where are the reforms? We need to strengthen the system comprehensively, not just opt for piecemeal optics,\" she noted.\"The new Act emphasizes punishment, which is a necessary step. Alongside deterrents, it’s crucial to address why students and institutions turn to cheating. Implementing technologies like digital question papers and online exams can reduce leaks. Educating students, educators, and parents about the consequences of cheating is essential. We also need to ease academic pressure with better resources and alternative paths to success. By focusing on prevention, we can ensure fair exams where success is earned through merit,\" suggested Rishi Sehgal, Advocate-on-Record at the Supreme Court of India.According to a report by the Indian Express, there have been 41 documented instances of leaks in recruitment exams over the last five years across 15 states. These have impacted as many as 14 million applicants, who were competing for just 104,000 posts.The enactment of the law follows widespread allegations of paper leaks in recent national exams such as NEET-UG 2024 and the cancellation of the UGC-NET, postponing of NEET-PG exam and the late night decision of govt to transfer matter of alleged irregularities in the NEET (UG) Examination 2024 to the CBI for a comprehensive investigation and eventually leading CBI to register the first FIR in the case.The government also formed a high-level committee to provide recommendations for enhancing the structure, processes, data management, and security protocols of the National Testing Agency (NTA). ;Following the release of the NEET 2024 results on 4 June before its scheduled date, numerous discrepancies came to light, notably the unprecedented occurrence of 67 students achieving perfect scores of 720/720. Questions were raised regarding the legitimacy of these scores, especially with reports that six students from a single center in Haryana achieved perfect scores.This led to uproar and widespread protests by students, coaching centres, and many social groups, which filed numerous petitions in the Supreme Court calling to completely scrap NEET-UG 2024 and this year, and some called for a retest.This eventually led the government to withdraw grace marks given to 1,536 students, providing them with revised scores and the option to reappear for the exam.Approximately 2.4 million candidates had participated in the entrance exam held on 5 May across 571 cities, including 14 centres located outside India.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T08:00:07+05:30"},

Earlier this month the central bank trimmed its key policy rate for the first time in more than four years and said more cuts were likely if inflation continued to show it was on a sustainable path back down to the 2% target.  Macklem told the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce that some people, in particular younger workers and newcomers, were finding it harder to obtain employment.  \"With some slack in the economy, there is room for the Canadian economy to grow and add more jobs even as inflation continues to move closer to the target,\" he said.  Macklem said the bank did not think a large rise in the jobless rate was needed to hit the 2% inflation target, a combination of factors he called a soft-landing scenario.  \"It has always been a narrow path and we have yet to fully stick the landing,\" he said  The fact that some newcomers are finding it harder to get a job could help the federal government, which is cutting back the number of people allowed in after levels spiked during the pandemic, driving up accommodation costs and population growth.  \"(This job search difficulty) suggests the government has some room to slow the growth of non-permanent residents without tightening the labor market too much and causing significant labor shortages,\" Macklem said.  The bank has long fretted about year-on-year wage growth but Macklem said there were signs it was starting to moderate.  He made no mention of a timeline for possible further easing. Before he spoke, money markets were expecting a 73% chance of another rate cut in July and a total of another three 25 basis point reductions this year.  The annual inflation rate slowed to a three-year low of 2.7% in April, marking four consecutive months of below 3%. The core measures of inflation - which are closely tracked by the bank - also continued to ease.  Statistics Canada is due to release the May inflation data on June 25.  The BoC’s next monetary policy decision is scheduled for July 24, when it will also update its economic forecasts.

And while there is still \"more work to do\" on bringing inflation down, she said, \"inflation is not the only risk we face.\"  Reducing inflation further will likely require restraining demand, she said, and while so far the unemployment rate - now 4% - remains below long-run sustainable levels, \"future labor market slowing could translate into higher unemployment.\" To avoid that, she said, the Fed must be both \"vigilant and open.\"  The Fed earlier this month left interest rates in the 5.25%-5.5% range where they have been since last July, and policymakers signaled they may cut interest rates only once this year, rather than the three rate cuts they expected back in March.  Daly did not say how many rate cuts, if any, she believes the Fed will need to deliver to navigate between the twin risks of still-too-high inflation and the potential for rising unemployment  As this point, she said, policy must be \"conditional\" and ready for any of several possible paths, including holding rates where they are for longer should inflation disappoint, or cutting them should the labor market soften more than expected.  And, she said, \"if we continue to see gradual declines in inflation and a slow rebalancing in the labor market, then we can normalize policy over time, as many expect.\"  Inflation by the Fed’s targeted measure, the year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures price index, was 2.7% in both April and March, up from readings of 2.5% in both February and January.  More recent data suggests the index may not have risen at all from April to May, according to economists’ forecasts.  \"The bumpiness of inflation data so far this year has not inspired confidence,\" Daly said. \"Recent readings are more encouraging, but it is hard to know if we are truly on track to sustainable price stability.\" (Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Andrea Ricci) ", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T23:32:27+05:30"},

According to him, there are three primary reasons for this positive inflow.Read here: FPIs snap 2-month selling streak, invest  ₹12,170 crore in Indian equities; 3 key reasons behind inflows“First, the continuity of the government assures ongoing reforms. Second, the Chinese economy is decelerating, as evidenced by a 12% decline in copper prices over the past month. Third, certain block deals in the market have been eagerly taken up by FPIs. However, these FPI inflows are concentrated in a select few stocks rather than being widespread across the market or sectors,” Damania saidHe believes that FPI inflows will remain constrained due to the high valuations currently commanded by the Indian equity market.Meanwhile, the highest FPI outflows was witnessed in the Oil, Gas &amp; Consumable Fuels sector worth  ₹3,683 crore during June 1-15.

The justices will review an appeals court ruling that overturned the approval issued by the Surface Transportation Board for the Uinta Basin Railway, an 88-mile (142-kilometer) railroad line. Arguments will take place in the fall.  The rail line would connect oil and gas producers in rural Utah to the broader rail network, allowing them to access larger markets and ultimately sell to refineries near the Gulf of Mexico. Producers who are currently limited to tanker trucks would be able to ship an additional 350,000 barrels of crude daily on trains extending for up to 2 miles (3.2 kilometers).  The railway is being pursued through a public-private partnership between infrastructure development and investment firm DHIP Group in Winter Park, Florida, and the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, a body formed by eastern Utah officials.  Other proponents include oil businesses and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah &amp; Ouray Reservation. They have argued that the railroad would be a boon to struggling local economies and boost domestic energy production.  The type of oil to be exported from Utah — waxy crude, which is semi-solid at room temperature — makes it more challenging to move. Currently it's heated and shipped in insulated trucks.  The oil's consistency, on the other hand, makes it less damaging and easier to clean up after spills, project proponents say.  The Supreme Court decision to hear the case was cause for optimism for the stalled railroad's developers.  “This project is vital for the economic growth and connectivity of the Uinta Basin region and we are committed to seeing it through,\" Keith Heaton, director of the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, said in a statement.  Environmental groups and Colorado's Eagle County, which sued to challenge the project, nonetheless worry about safety and potential train derailments. From the railway in Utah, the oil trains would enter Colorado, following the Colorado River upstream and over the Rocky Mountains to Denver and beyond.  Colorado U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and U.S. Rep Joe Neguse, both Democrats, oppose the project, asserting that an oil spill in the Colorado River headwaters would be catastrophic.  Environmental groups also contend that the rail line will allow more oil to be extracted and burned, contributing to climate change.  The federal appeals court in Washington ruled last year that the Surface Transportation Board's environmental approval was rushed and violated federal law.  The issue at the Supreme Court is whether the agency should have weighed the potential environmental harm of the railroad's main cargo, both where the oil is drilled in Utah and refined on the Gulf Coast, when it has no regulatory authority over oil production.  “It’s disappointing the Supreme Court took up this case but the appellate court’s decision on this destructive project is legally sound and should ultimately stand,” Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.  The railroad would still need additional review and government approvals to proceed even if its developers prevail before the Supreme Court, the group noted.  ___  Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.  ___  Gruver reported from Cheyenne, Wyoming.

PSU banks also look attractive from a valuation perspective,\" said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.The Nifty Bank index is up almost 9 per cent year-to-date, while the Nifty 50 has gained over 9 per cent in the same period.\"Most of the private banking stocks had missed the upsurge seen in recent weeks, and hence there was a flurry of activity in the financial space ahead of the monthly expiry on Thursday,” Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities, observed.Factors such as the prospects of a healthy monsoon, a solid macro outlook, and expectations of policy continuity after the new government took charge also contributed to underpinning market sentiment.Technical factorsShrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, pointed out that a bullish candle on daily charts and higher bottom formation on intraday charts indicate a continuation of an uptrend wave in the near future.\"For the trend-following traders now, 23,600/77,500 would act as a trend decider level. As long as the index trades above the same, positive sentiment will likely continue,\" said Chouhan.\"On the higher side, 23,835-23,900/78,500-78,700 would be the immediate resistance zones for the bulls. However, below 23,600/77,500 uptrend would be vulnerable. Below the same, trades may prefer to exit out from the trading long positions,\" said Chouhan.Technical charts indicate Bank Nifty index may rise further.According to Kunal Shah, Senior Technical &amp; Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities, the Bank Nifty index broke above the resistance of 52,000, where the highest open interest was built up on the call side.\"The index is trading in a strong uptrend with higher highs and higher lows intact on the daily chart. The support now stands at 52,000, and intraday dips should be viewed as a buying opportunity for targets of 53,000/53,500,\" said Shah.Where is the market heading?Overall, experts are positive about the Indian stock market for the medium term due to the country's healthy macro outlook. As the elections are over now, the next big trigger for the market is the Union Budget, which is expected in July.Besides, expectations of rate cuts by the end of this year are another factor that can boost the market.\"A favourable Budget can further boost the market, which has already touched new highs since the election results were out. Investors are also looking forward to rate cuts by the central bank,\" Sarvjeet Singh Virk, the co-founder and managing director of Shoonya by Finvasia, told Mint.\"If the Fed cuts rates, foreign investors will turn towards the equity market, and India, one of the brightest spots now, will attract them further. Moreover, with rate cuts, both demand and supply can surge, boosting the business environment and the economy,\" said Virk.But the rising valuation of the Indian stock market can spoil the party.\"All equity segments—large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps—are trading at the higher end of their TTM (trailing 12-month) P/B (price-to-book) ranges, indicating subdued returns in the coming year,\" Nitin Bhasin, the head of institutional equities at Ambit, told Mint.Bhasin pointed out that large caps are relatively inexpensive. However, there is a significant divergence in valuations between BFSI and non-BFSI sectors.\"Currently, the Nifty Ex-BFSI universe trades at an all-time high premium of 44 per cent over BFSI on a 12-month forward P/E (price-to-earnings) basis, compared to a five-year average of nearly 6 per cent,\" said Bhasin.\"We do not anticipate market multiples sustaining, as FY25 is expected to normalize earnings trajectory estimates,\" Bhasin said.Read all market-related news hereDisclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts, and brokerage firms, not Mint.

Here's why | Stock Market News", "Author": "Bloomberg", "Content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s three-day, $430 billion selloff has traders turning to technical analysis for clues on where the bottom may be.The stock has fallen 13% since briefly overtaking Microsoft Corp. last week as the world’s most valuable company. That’s pushed Nvidia shares into a technical correction – when a stock drops 10% or more from a recent peak — for the first time since April. The stock was set to extend losses Tuesday, dropping as much as 2.4% in premarket trade.The abrupt reversal has included some tell-tale signs of capitulation, according to Buff Dormeier, chief technical analyst at Kingsview Partners.“The fact that this is happening following all this good news — the split, becoming the largest company — is a concern,” he said, referring to the 10-for-1 stock split announced last month. Dormeier sees short-term support around the $115 level, with the next significant level at $100.The $115 area for Nvidia shares is near a key Fibonacci retracement level, a tool used by technical analysts to identify support or resistance lines for stocks and other assets. The 38.2% retracement from the stock’s intraday low in April to its record high last week is about 2% below Monday’s closing price. While technical analysis — which looks for insight in historic trading patterns — isn’t precise, it can provide a useful roadmap for investors.Nvidia has soared this year amid unrelenting demand for its chips that dominate the market for artificial intelligence computing. The latest leg of the advance saw the stock rise 43% from its May 22 earnings report and stock split announcement to the June 18 peak when the stock closed with a market value of $3.34 trillion, topping Microsoft at $3.32 trillion. Despite the three-day drop since then, Nvidia is still up 139% this year.For Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, the longer-term trend is more important than any specific level for Nvidia and it remains strong with the stock still trading well above its 50-day moving average around $101 and 100-day moving average at $92. “Typically major tops are a process, with several rounds of buying and selling and then price momentum creeps in and there’s a failure to hold key levels. We haven’t seen anything like that yet,” he said in an interview. “This is just how Nvidia trades.”While he believes the long-term up trend remains intact, like Dormeier, he’s keeping an eye on the $100 level. “For a stock in an uptrend like Nvidia, breaching that first level of support wouldn’t be a concern,” said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Granite Wealth Management. A drop below $100, however, would be, he said.“That may not have long-term implications, but it would signal that you should be patient, especially in a period where the market is likely to be volatile and have a downward bias as we await the election and the Fed weighing in on rates.” Tech Chart of the DayTop Tech NewsBitcoin and Nvidia Corp. just reminded investors that the market’s hottest trades are far from one-way bets.Apple Inc. rejected overtures by Meta Platforms Inc. to integrate the social networking company’s AI chatbot into the iPhone months ago, according to people with knowledge of the matter.For the producers of Hot Ones, one of the most popular original programs on YouTube, this year has yielded one success after another.

This new offering aims to broaden Netflix's audience by providing access to its extensive content library at no cost, aligning with the company's strategy to expand its user base and compete with local free TV services.A Bloomberg report highlights that Netflix's initiative is targeting regions where free, ad-supported television networks are already prevalent. Insiders suggest this plan is designed to attract more viewers and bolster Netflix's competitive position against regional free TV offerings.For advertisers, the introduction of a free plan is expected to lead to a substantial increase in viewership and, consequently, higher ad revenue for Netflix. The company is also working on developing its own advertising technology platform, which is slated to launch by the end of 2025. This platform is anticipated to provide advertisers with enhanced tools for purchasing ads, gaining insights, and measuring campaign effectiveness.Netflix recently reported a remarkable increase in the adoption of its ad-supported tier, with global monthly active users climbing to 40 million, up from just five million a year earlier. This dramatic growth underscores the success of Netflix's strategy to attract new users with a more affordable plan.The expansion of the ad-supported tier comes amid intense competition in the streaming industry, where companies are increasingly offering bundles to retain subscribers. Since its launch in November 2022, Netflix's ad-supported plan has gained significant traction, with 40 percent of all new sign-ups in eligible countries coming from these plans.Notably, research by Antenna indicated that during the fourth quarter, ad-supported plans were the primary source of new subscribers for the streaming industry, marking the first time such a trend has been observed.As part of its ongoing efforts to enhance its advertising capabilities, Netflix has announced plans to launch an internal advertising technology platform by the end of 2025. This strategic initiative aims to provide clients with innovative methods for procuring advertisements and improving user engagement.To expedite automated ad buying, Netflix will partner with industry leaders such as Trade Desk, Google Display &amp; Video 360, and ad-tech firm Magnite, alongside Microsoft.Netflix's ad-supported plan, priced at $6.99 per month, offers a competitive alternative to other streaming services. For comparison, Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming service Max offers monthly plans starting at $9.99, while Walt Disney's Disney+ subscription begins at $7.99 per month.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T17:06:19+05:30"},

This coupled with El Nino causing patchy rainfall and a prolonged dry spell last year has left water reservoirs drying. ;As per the latest data from the Central Water Commission, live storage available in the country’s 150 key reservoirs as of 20 June was 37.662 BCM (billion cubic metres), 21% of the live storage capacity and 80% lower than last year.Moody’s Ratings warned on Tuesday that India’s annual average per capita water availability is likely to drop to 1,367 cubic metres by 2031 from an already-low 1,486 cubic metres in 2021. A level below 1,700 cubic metres indicates water stress, with 1,000 cubic metres being the threshold for water scarcity, according to the water ministry.Also Read: India to get ’below normal’ rainfall in June, says IMDIn the last financial year (FY24), power generation declined 17.33% to 133.97 billion units, from 162.05 billion units in FY23, according to the Central Electricity Authority. ;In April, hydro power generation fell 7.71% on a year-on-basis to 7.99 billion units.\"Given the delay in progress of monsoons and the lower reservoir levels, hydro power generation is expected to be flattish compared to last year, considering the base case expectation of a normal southwest monsoon rainfall as per IMD (India Meteorological Department)’s prediction. ;However, if the rainfall remains below normal, hydro power generation may even fall compared to last year. Further, some of the hydro power plants were shut down last year due to adverse impact of floods and cloudbursts and all of these plants are yet to resume operations,\" said Vikram V, vice-president & co-group head, corporate ratings, ICRA.Also Read: Monsoon to gather pace next week; cover country ahead of schedule, says private forecaster SkymetNoting the significance of hydro generation during the monsoon months, Vikram V added: “It is largely during the first half of a financial year that hydro generation peaks. Last year, out of the 134 billion units produced in the whole of the financial year, 90 billion units of hydro power were generated in the first half.”Usually starting June-July, hydro power generation contributes significantly to the country’s power supply. This time around, however, coal-fired power plants are expected to continue taking the load given that hydro plants are yet to pitch in with higher generation. ;A recent report by S&P Global said that India’s weak hydroelectricity production in recent times might stimulate further usage of coal to fulfill its rising power demand.Depleting hydroelectricity output led to lower water level\"Depleting hydroelectricity output amid irregular rainfall in the past fiscal has led to a lower water level available in the country’s primary reservoirs which could further reduce India’s hydropower generation during the summer,\" it said.India’s installed large hydro capacity stands at 46.92 GW, which is about 10% of the total power generation capacity of 442.85 GW. The capacity addition of hydropower also has not gained momentum over the past year. According to data from CEA, in FY24, only 60 MW of capacity was added compared to 120 MW in the previous fiscal (FY23).Indira Sagar reservoir in Madhya Pradesh, which caters to a hydel capacity of 1 GW, is 17% full, compared with 24% last year. Koyana dam in Maharashtra, with a hydro power capacity of 1.9 GW, is 10% full currently. Although it’s better than 6% during the same period last year, it’s lower than the normal level of 15% during this time of the year.This fall in reservoir levels, delay in rains and the eventual impact on hydro power generation comes at a time when the power demand has already hit a record high and continue to remain elevated amid a prolonged heatwave.On 30 May, the peak power demand of the country touched a new record high of 250 GW.Moody’s Ratings noted that India is facing increasing water stress amid rapid economic growth and climate change. It noted that this shortage of water supply can disrupt several sectors including agricultural production and industrial operations. Industries where the usage of water is higher, such as coal power plants and steel makers would also be impacted.So far, thermal power plants have catered to the rising demand. However, during this time of the year several thermal plants go under maintenance which is key for smooth operations. This year, with the delay in the rains in north India, several plants have not gone through the required maintenance, which may lead to faults and trippings in power supply.Meanwhile, the IMD on Tuesday said, “Conditions are likely to become favourable for further advance of Southwest Monsoon into remaining parts of North Arabian Sea, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh some parts of Rajasthan, West Uttar Pradesh, remaining parts of Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar, most parts of East Uttar Pradesh, parts of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, northern parts of Punjab and Haryana in the next three-four days.”", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T17:12:20+05:30"},

So, the question was if there can be an exemption for PE funds,\" Srini Sriniwasan, vice-chairperson of the industry body for alternative assests, told Mint in an interview on Tuesday.Besides, the IVCA discussed measures to boost domestic capital in alternative investment funds (AIFs) to finance infrastructure, credit, startups and growth companies in the pre-budget consultation meeting on 20 June.The finance minister is expected to present the budget by July end.Also Read: Budget 2024: Govt tightens purse strings but finds money for some welfareSriniwasan, who is also the managing director of Kotak Alternate Asset Managers Ltd, asked for more clarity on the definition of what constitutes a PE investor. “This money, which is coming from foreign direct investments (FDIs), is not seen as an organized pool of capital as AIFs, which at this point in time is the only recognized PE pool under the law,” he said.When foreign investors invest through the FDI route, it becomes very hard to distinguish whether it is a PE fund or a strategic investor as the recipient of that money is either a company or the government, he explained. Therefore, a clearer definition that considers the broad-based nature of PE firms, which include both direct and indirect investors, will be imperative.Chrys Capital’s Ashley Menezes and Rajat Tandon, the president of the industry body, were also part of the discussions.&nbsp;Also Read: Budget 2024: It’s tax buoyancy that shrank the deficitBudget expectationsThe IVCA is looking for more clarity on taxation of investments in securities that are more readily available to foreign portfolio investors. “What we are asking for is to have the same parity as them, make it as clear and put out additional circular clarifications as the case may be,” Sriniwasan said.There also needs to be more clarity about the taxation on current interest. “At the IVCA, our primary concern is that people who are domiciling their business in India are collecting money, not just from domestic investors but also from foreign investors. This subjects them to the regulatory oversight in India and contributes to it,” he said, adding that the policies adopted are going to be the critical aspect of how growth is driven to AIFs in the country.He also alluded to the missed opportunity for domestic investors as over 80% of exits have gone to investors outside the country. He emphasized that these domestic institutional pools of money have been reluctant participants in the industry due to a host of reasons, which include poor past experiences, lesser understanding or the lack of ability to underwrite the managers or strategies.Also Read: Banks versus AIFs: Govt enters the picture“As an industry, we want to ensure that the AIF industry can also be a hedge for us as a nation to counter the volatility of global capital like how the mutual funds industry must counterbalance foreign portfolios,” he said.The industry executives also appealed for more regulatory and legal clarity on AIFs as an asset. The lack of proper recognition has led to a grey area where they end up being taxed at the highest level, which becomes a cause of concern for foreign as well as domestic investors. So, more provisions are needed to level the playing field, Sriniwasan said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T17:15:55+05:30"},

She suggests that the RBI may proceed with a rate cut, even if the US Fed defers, provided domestic inflation moderates. In an interview with Mint, Sinha discusses the state of the Indian economy, emerging trends, and the impact of AI technology.Edited excerpts:What is the outlook for the Indian economy for the current financial year? What can derail the growth momentum?The high-frequency economic indicators like GST collection, car sales, and PMI show continued growth momentum in the Indian economy. ;However, weak consumption concerns linger.If we get a normal monsoon this year, that should help stabilise food inflation and improve consumption demand, specifically rural consumption. ;The government’s focus on investment is expected to continue this year. ;While private investment remains feeble, it could improve in the next few quarters with rising capacity utilisation levels. ;However, the critical requirement for that will be a sustained and broad-based improvement in consumption. ;The private sector shows increased intent to invest, as reflected by CMIE data on announced investment projects. ;While India’s services exports have remained healthy, merchandise exports are expected to improve as global trade gathers momentum. ;India’s GDP growth will likely moderate in FY25, but it will remain healthy at around 7 per cent. ;Normal monsoons with healthy spatial and temporal rainfall distribution will be critical for agriculture, specifically when reservoir levels are very low. ;Healthy monsoons are critical to pushing up rural demand, which has been feeble since the pandemic. ;A normal monsoon will also aid in containing food inflation that remains high. ;In June, the monsoons have been below the LPA (long-period average); however, it could improve in the next few days. ;We must also remain cautious of global risks, given that global growth is still precarious and geopolitical concerns linger.Inflation is easing, but do you think it will fall below the RBI’s short-term target of 4 per cent anytime soon?Inflation has been moderating in the last few months, with core inflation remaining below RBI’s 4 per cent target for the last five months. ;However, food inflation remains high at 7-8 per cent, with high double-digit inflation in vegetables and pulses. ;Normal monsoons with good rainfall distribution will be critical for bringing down food inflation. ;We also need to be watchful of global commodity prices. ;Global industrial metal prices have risen by around 9 per cent in the last three months. ;Ongoing geopolitical tensions must be monitored, given the risk they can pose to global supply chains and commodity prices, specifically global crude oil prices. ;CPI inflation will likely moderate further and slip below RBI’s target in July-Aug, supported by the base effect. ;However, it is estimated to rise again to around 5 per cent level in Q3 and Q4. We estimate average CPI inflation around 4.5-4.8 per cent in FY25. ;Keeping CPI inflation at RBI’s target of 4 per cent on a sustained basis will be challenging.Can the RBI cut rates before the US Fed? When can we expect a rate cut?RBI has reiterated that domestic factors will be critical for their policy decision, even while they will be watchful of actions taken by global central banks. RBI is likely to continue focusing on domestic inflation. ;As core inflation has been moderating, the critical factor would be food inflation. ;If food inflation moderates and there is no supply-side push to global commodity prices, we could see RBI going for a shallow policy rate cut by the end of the current year. ;With signs of moderation in US inflation, the Federal Reserve will also likely go for a policy rate cut in the second half of 2024. ;However, even if the Federal Reserve defers the rate cut decision, RBI may still go ahead with the rate cut, provided domestic inflation moderates. ;India’s external sector is in a comfortable position, with strong FII inflows expected as India gets included in global bond indices. Forex reserves are at a comfortable level of around US$ 653 billion. ;Hence, the RBI could proceed with a shallow rate cut, even if the US Fed defers a rate cut. ;The most critical aspect for India’s central bank would be sustained moderation in domestic inflation.Slowing consumption has been a concern. How can we see a rise in consumption? What steps can the current government take to boost it?Weak consumption, specifically in the lower-income category and rural areas, has been a cause of concern for the Indian economy. ;Consumption GDP has grown by 4 per cent in Q4FY24, against a pre-pandemic level of around 7 per cent growth. ;As we advance, rural demand will likely improve based on the assumption of normal monsoons in the current year. ;Subsequent containment of food inflation will also help improve consumption spending. ;There has been an improvement in consumer sentiments, as reflected by RBI’s household survey. ;However, good monsoons and containment of food inflation would be critical elements for broad-based improvement in consumer spending in the near term. ;Over a longer period, the most crucial aspect would be improving the employment scenario. ;This will help improve consumer sentiments on a sustained basis. ;The new government should focus on creating more job opportunities in the organised and unorganised sectors. ;It will also be critical for the government to equip the population adequately to enable them to get absorbed into the labour force. ;The government’s focus on capex should also help propel the economy through a multiplier effect. ;In the near term, the government should consider giving some tax reliefs to the lower-income category to boost consumer sentiments and propel consumption spending. ;The government has the challenging task of balancing fiscal prudence while continuing to focus on capex-induced growth. ;Keeping that in mind, it will be a tightrope walk for the government.How critical is the monsoon for the Indian economy? What does an above-normal monsoon mean for the Indian economy?Agriculture contributes around 15 per cent to India’s GDP, but a large part of India’s workforce (around 46 per cent) is employed in agriculture. ;Hence, normal monsoons are critical not just for agriculture sector output but also have a strong bearing on overall rural demand. ;Good monsoons are much required not just for the Kharif crop but also for the Rabi crop, as reservoir levels are currently very low due to poor monsoons last year. ;Rural demand has been weak, even due to the poor monsoon season last year. ;While in the last few months, there has been some recovery in rural demand, a normal monsoon this year would be critical to ensure sustained and meaningful recovery in rural demand. ;Rural demand has a strong bearing on sectors like FMCG, cement, paint, auto and consumer durables. ;Normal monsoons with good spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall will also help reduce high food inflation. This, in turn, will help boost the economy’s overall consumption.Can we see some short-term negative impacts on the cement and paint sectors due to the monsoon?Historically, paints and cement sales have been observed to remain lowest in the second quarter of the financial year due to the monsoon and gradually pick up by the end of the second quarter. ;A similar trend is expected in this financial year as well. However, over a longer period of time, both sectors should benefit from normal monsoons and recovery from rural demand.What do you think about AI’s emergence? How can we leverage it to boost the Indian economy?The emergence of AI has positive and negative implications, especially for a labour-abundant economy like India. ;On the positive side, the emergence of AI will lead to productivity improvement and increased efficiency. ;On the flip side, it could result in some jobs getting redundant. This becomes critical at a juncture when employing India’s large workforce is already a challenge. ;The best way to leverage AI would be by moving up the value chain in the technology sector. ;India has the benefit of a large STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workforce and has already made rapid progress in digitalisation. ;We should increase our focus on R&D to ensure that we have an edge and that our workforce is adequately skilled to participate in the evolution of AI. ;We should leverage AI to create more jobs in emerging sectors and improve productivity in traditional sectors.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of the expert, not Mint.

Before visiting a bank during this period, it’s advisable to verify the exact holidays observed, as they may vary by location.&nbsp;The RBI has designated the following dates as bank holidays under the Negotiable Instruments Act: July 3, 6, 8, 9, 16, and 17. This implies that transactions involving checks and promissory notes may not be available on these days.The following table shows the bank holidays in July 2024 in various states in India.&nbsp;Behdienkhlam is a festival observed mainly by the Pnar community in Meghalaya, India. Held annually in July, it is a significant dance festival among the Jaintia people. The event serves as a prayer to ward off malevolent spirits and diseases, seeking blessings for a prosperous harvest.MHIP stands for Mizo Hmeichhe Insuihkhawm Pawl, which translates to “uniting Mizo women,” and it is the largest women's organization in Mizoram, not Manipur. This day, celebrated on July 6th in Mizoram, marks the organization's founding anniversary.Kang, also known as Kang Chingba, is a lively festival celebrated in Manipur, a northeastern state of India. It mirrors the Ratha Yatra festival of Puri, Odisha, in the Manipuri tradition.Drukpa Tse-zi, also referred to as Drukpa Teshi, holds great importance as a festival celebrated by the Buddhist community in Sikkim, a northeastern state of India. The festival commemorates the auspicious occasion when Gautama Buddha delivered his first sermon, known as \"Setting the Wheel of Dharma in Motion,\" to his initial five disciples at Sarnath, India. This sermon introduced the Four Noble Truths, which form the cornerstone of Buddhist teachings.The Harela festival in Uttarakhand is a lively celebration that heralds the onset of the monsoon and the start of a new agricultural cycle. Translating to \"day of green\" in Hindi, Harela underscores the significance of greenery, environmental conservation, and a prosperous harvest. It is predominantly observed in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand, while variations like Mol-Sankranti or Rai-Sagarant are celebrated in the Garhwal region.Muharram/Ashura occurs on the 10th day of the first month (Muharram) in the Islamic calendar. It is a solemn occasion for Muslims globally, honoring the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, during the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE. Shia Muslims mark this day with mourning processions (tazias) and rituals that symbolize sacrifice and fortitude.U Tirot Sing Day in Meghalaya commemorates the courage and resistance of U Tirot Sing, a revered freedom fighter who fiercely opposed British colonial rule in the region during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Though not a national holiday, Meghalaya observes this day with tributes and cultural events to honor his legacy and significant contributions to the struggle for independence.Apart from the national and regional holidays mandated by the RBI, banks in India are also closed on:Sundays: This is customary in many countries. There are four Sundays in July occurring on July 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th.Second and fourth Saturdays: This closure pattern recurs throughout the year, with exceptions in December and January when there may be only one or no closures on the second or fourth Saturday due to holiday season business requirements. The second and fourth Saturdays occur on July 13th and 27th.&nbsp;RBI OversightThe determination of bank holidays in India is overseen by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

I propose to increase the rebate limit to  ₹7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, persons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to pay any tax,” said Finance Minister while presenting Budget 2023.“The new tax regime has got a great boost by the Budget announcements made by the FM. Taxpayers at both ends of the spectrum will be encouraged under the new regime, as there will be no liability upto annual income of 7 lacs on 1 hand &amp; surcharge on annual income above 5 crores has been reduced from 37 to 25% at the high income end,” said Alok Agrawal, Partner, Deloitte India.Here are the 5 income tax rule changes announced by FM Sitharaman in Budget 2023&nbsp;1) Tax rebate limit raised to  ₹7 lakh from  ₹5 lakhAbhishek A Rastogi, Founder of Rastogi Chambers said in simple words, the enhancement of this limit to  ₹7 lakh means that the person whose income is less than  ₹7 lakhs need not invest anything to claim exemptions and the entire income would be tax-free irrespective of the quantum of investment made by such an individual.&nbsp;This will result in giving more consumption power to the middle-class income group as they could spend the entire amount of income without bothering too much about investment schemes to take the benefit of exemptions, he added.2) Changes in Income Tax slabs“I propose to change the tax structure in new &nbsp;regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and increasing the tax exemption limit to  ₹3 lakh,” said FM Sitharaman.The new tax rates are0-3 lakh - nil3-6 lakh - 5%6-9 lakh- 10%9-12 lakh - 15%12-15 lakh - 20%above 15 lakh- 30%The new system will decrease the six income categories to five.“Tax assessors will still be able to choose from the prior regime. Salaried and pensioners: the new system's standard deduction for taxable income exceeding Rs15.5 lakhs is  ₹52,500,” said Amit Gupta, MD, SAG Infotech3) For pensioners, the finance minister announced extending the benefit of standard deduction to new tax regime. Each salaried person with an income of  ₹15.5 lakh or more will benefit by  ₹52,500.4) Maximum tax, along with surcharge, will be 39%“The highest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the highest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 per cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction of the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent,” announced FM while presenting Budget 2023.\"Tax rates have been reduced under the new tax regime and the maximum marginal rate drops from 42.74% to 39%,” said Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner, Deloitte India5) Leave encashmentLastly, the limit of  ₹3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment on retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the year 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was  ₹30,000 pm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to increase this limit to  ₹25 lakh.New income tax regime to be default regimeAmit Gupta, MD, SAG Infotech said that the new information technology system will act as the default tax regime. Tax assessors will still be able to choose from the prior regime. Salaried and pensioners: the new system's standard deduction for taxable income exceeding Rs.15.5 lakhs is  ₹52,500.“The government is actively promoting the new tax regime, which will now be the default tax regime. The basic exemption under this regime has increased to 3 lakhs from 2.5 lakhs. Individual tax payers earning up to  ₹7 lakhs will not have to pay taxes as compared to current limit of  ₹5 lakhs,” said Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner, Deloitte India.The government in Budget 2020-21 brought in an optional income tax regime, under which individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) were to be taxed at lower rates if they did not avail specified exemptions and deductions, like house rent allowance (HRA), interest on home loan, investments made under Section 80C, 80D and 80CCD.

But crypto experts call for caution — here is why | Stock Market News", "Author": "Vimal Chander Joshi", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/vimal-chander-joshi", "Content": "In the run-up to the bitcoin halving event, bitcoin prices regained $70,000 on Thursday in the international crypto markets. The most popular crypto token traded around $70,600, rising 4.5 per cent in the past 24 hours.Meanwhile, ethereum rose 3.4 per cent to trade at $3,552, Binance Coin rose 4.5 per cent to trade at $604, Solana spiked 6.26 per cent to trade at $174 and Dogecoin spiked 6.76 per cent to trade at $0.195, according to the CoinDesk data.At the same time, Grayscale’s bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) shows nearly $18 million outflows on Wednesday, a record low since going live in January.It is expected that bitcoin’s halving event, expected later this&nbsp;month, will raise the prices of other tokens of the bitcoin ecosystem.What is bitcoin halving?For the uninitiated, halving lowers the rate at which new bitcoin coins are minted, and therefore brings the new supply down.&nbsp;As of now, the existing block reward is 6.25 BTC, which will drop to 3.125 BTC once the halving takes place.The most recent halving took place on May 11, 2020, resulting in a 12 per cent increase in prices during the subsequent week. This month marks the fourth occurrence of such an event since 2012.&nbsp;Profit booking ahead?However, some crypto experts have cautioned the investors against being too bullish on the halving event as it could create selling pressure in the days before and after the event, due on April 20.&nbsp;ALSO READ: Bitcoin gained 150% in FY24, to remain in positive trajectory in FY25: ExpertsArthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX said in a blog post that when most market participants agree on a certain outcome, the opposite usually happens.“The Bitcoin block reward is forecast to halve on April 20th. This is seen as a bullish catalyst for crypto markets. I agree that it will pump prices in the medium term; however, the price action directly before and after could be negative. The narrative of the halving being positive for crypto prices is well entrenched,” he wrote in his post on Heatwave.Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, also believes that investors could resort to profit-booking ahead of halving.“The upcoming halving in less than 10 days will reduce block rewards from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125 Bitcoin. This price action is a result of long-term investors booking profits ahead of the forthcoming halving. For instance, Grayscale (GBTC) had a net outflow of over 2,990 BTC,” says Thakral.“Traders should be careful about both bull and bear scenarios, as there is a good chance that some profit booking will take place at the time of halving as well,” CoinSwitch Markets Desk wrote in a statement.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-04-11T20:22:39+05:30"},

Investors who recognised its potential early on have seen their investments multiply significantly, showcasing the stock's impressive turnaround and upward trajectory. Such extraordinary gains not only reflect its past success but also highlight its potential as a high-return investment opportunity over the years.Meanwhile, over the past three years, the stock has surged by an impressive 391 percent, climbing from  ₹10.87 in June 2021 to its current levels.In recent times as well, HCC has continued to demonstrate strong performance, gaining 153 percent over the past year and 83.5 percent year-to-date in 2024. The stock has delivered positive returns in three out of the six months so far this year. In June, it rallied over 41 percent following a 2 percent decline in May. Prior to that, it showed robust gains of 20 percent in April but declined 21.2 percent in March and 8.7 percent in February. Notably, January 2024 saw a significant increase of 53.4 percent in the stock's value.Moreover, the stock also hit its 52-week high of  ₹53.40 in intra-day deals today, June 25, 2024. It has shown strong resilience by surging over 199 percent from its 52-week low of  ₹17.84, recorded on July 26, 2023.About the firmHindustan Construction Company Limited provides comprehensive engineering and construction services across India and globally. The company specialises in a wide range of projects including roads, highways, bridges, railways, metro rails, ports, and marine structures. It also undertakes the construction of dams, tunnels, powerhouses, and various underground works, as well as projects in water supply, irrigation, sewage treatment, and hydrocarbon plants. Additionally, the company offers services in toll management, real estate development, insurance, information technology consulting, and operation and maintenance of roads. Established in 1926, Hindustan Construction Company Limited is headquartered in Mumbai, India.EarningsIn the March quarter (Q4FY24), Hindustan Construction Company reported a 22.12 percent increase in consolidated net profit, amounting to  ₹246.2 crore compared to  ₹201.6 crore in the year-ago period. Total income for the quarter was  ₹1,813.05 crore, down from  ₹2,437.23 crore a year earlier, while total expenses decreased to  ₹2,073.33 crore from  ₹2,398.69 crore.For the fiscal year 2023-24, HCC recorded a consolidated net profit of  ₹529.42 crore, a significant turnaround from a net loss of  ₹52.51 crore in FY23.Brokerage viewsRecently, Elara Securities initiated coverage on Hindustan Construction Company with a ‘buy’ rating, being optimistic about its potential resurgence. Elara set a target price of  ₹63 per share, indicating an 18 percent upside from current levels. The brokerage highlighted HCC's significant improvement in financial health, with standalone debt reducing from  ₹6,200 crore in FY22 to  ₹3,400 crore in FY24.Elara forecasts a robust growth trajectory for HCC, expecting standalone revenue and EBITDA to achieve a 20 percent CAGR during FY24-27E, driven by lower interest costs contributing to a 50 percent earnings CAGR. Positioned well to capitalise on the  ₹1.5 lakh crore nuclear opportunity, HCC is anticipated to secure order inflows of around  ₹9,000 crore, slightly below its guidance of  ₹10,000 crore, with expected annual inflows increasing by 15 percent over the next two years.Meanwhile, ICICI Direct has also observed strong momentum in Hindustan Construction Company, noting that its stock price is currently trading above short-, medium-, and long-term moving averages. The company has shown robust trailing twelve months (TTM) EPS growth and continues to demonstrate strong annual EPS growth trends. These factors indicate a positive market sentiment and a bullish outlook for HCC, supported by its consistent financial performance and growth trajectory.However, its weaknesses, as per ICICI Direct, are:- Red Flag: High interest payments compared to earnings- MFs decreased their shareholding last quarter- Declining net cash flow: The company is not able to generate net cashInvesting in stocks with smaller market capitalisation offers the potential for significant returns due to their lower price points, but it comes with inherent risks. Small-cap stocks often grapple with liquidity challenges, resulting in lower trading volumes compared to larger firms. Moreover, they may face less stringent financial reporting requirements and oversight, potentially exposing them to market manipulation and fraudulent activities.These factors contribute to heightened volatility in small-cap stocks, increasing the risk for investors. Effective navigation of these challenges requires thorough research and the implementation of robust risk management strategies. By adopting these measures, investors can better handle the uncertainties associated with small-cap stocks and safeguard themselves against potential losses.Disclaimer: This story is for educational purposes only.

And it comes at a price of $19,000. Blue Cube, based in Redmond, Ore., makes cold plunge units that cost between around $18,000 and $29,000.“Cold plunging has made a profound difference in my life,” Garten says. He says it has brought him health benefits including stress management.Previously the domain of athletes, bathing in cold water or ice has become a mainstream wellness trend across the U.S. The practice goes by many terms, like cold plunging, ice bathing and cold-immersion therapy. Water temperature below 59 degrees Fahrenheit is generally considered cold immersion. People who swear by it say they’ve experienced wide-ranging health benefits, like reduced anxiety, alleviated joint and muscle pain and boosted energy and focus.But while many people are experimenting with do-it-yourself methods—like taking cold showers or filling kiddie pools, horse troughs and unplugged chest freezers with cold water or ice—some enthusiasts have leveled-up their at-home cold plunging set-ups with sophisticated receptacles priced at tens of thousands of dollars and up.Developers, meanwhile, are adding cold plunges to amenity-rich luxury complexes like 53 West 53 in New York and Cipriani Residences Miami, betting that cold immersion is here to stay.“Ice bathing seems like a trend, but people have been doing this for thousands of years,” says Jonathan Coon, co-founder of Austin Capital Partners, which is the developer of Four Seasons Private Residences Lake Austin, 20 minutes from downtown Austin, slated to open in 2026.In addition to 188 residential units starting at $4.1 million, the Lake Austin property on 145 acres will have 76,000 square feet of indoor wellness and sports facilities, including a 12,000-square-foot orangery, 82-foot swimming pool, sauna, steam room and, of course, cold and hot thermal baths.Amenities covering 100,000 square feet is a key reason that Onyx W. D. Johnson and Cristian Santangelo bought a $2.2 million two-bedroom, 1,123-square-foot apartment in New York’s One Manhattan Square, an 80-story building located on the Lower East Side. Facilities include a spa with a tranquility garden, 75-foot saltwater swimming pool, hot tub, sauna, steam room and hammam with a cold plunge set between 55 and 58 degrees Fahrenheit. The couple moved into the apartment in May 2021.Johnson and Santangelo quivered at the idea of cold plunging until they started seeing other people dipping and discussing the health benefits. “We decided to give it a try,” Johnson says.Now cold plunging is part of their wellness regimen. Johnson, 50, who runs a management consulting firm, uses the hot pool, steam room and sauna, and then cold plunges for 45 seconds to a minute. He says this routine speeds up his training recovery time, helps him think clearer and improves his alertness and mood. Santangelo, 45, who is a management consultant, says the ritual helps him calm down and fight anxiety and stress.Diamond Spas &amp; Pools, based in Frederick, Colo., is a custom manufacturer of luxury pools, spas and soaking tubs for homeowners globally. The company added cold plunges to its portfolio in 2015 and saw one or two orders annually until 2019, when it experienced a sales surge. “Our cold plunge projects have increased ten times since then,” says Mitch Martinek, the company’s design manager.Martinek attributes the uptick to several factors. Today’s homeowners want gym and spa amenities at home and on-demand, cold therapy health benefits are better known now, and there are lingering pandemic concerns over public wellness facilities.The company’s cold plunges, which chill water to between 40 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit, are made from stainless steel or copper and can be camouflaged in tile, stone or wood. The pools can go indoors or outdoors, come in any size and can work with home automation systems. The average cold plunge costs about $45,000, with elaborate projects running closer to about $65,000.One of the company’s most unique cold plunges had an acrylic bottom and was in a high-rise building. “It was on a deck with a fire pit below,” Martinek says. “The homeowner wanted to be able to look up through the cold plunge.”John Thorbahn bought a four-bedroom, 5,500-square-foot single-family home in Hingham, Mass., south of Boston, in March 2020 for $1.6 million. He owns a cold plunge from Phoenix-based company Morozko Forge, founded in 2018. Morozko Forge’s entry-level unit costs $12,850; its upgraded version costs $19,900.Morozko Forge’s ice baths make ice. While the stainless steel tub is filled with cold water, an ice slab starts building at the tank’s bottom. At about 1-inch thick, the ice detaches and floats to the water’s surface. The ice can be broken up with an implement like a rubber mallet if needed.Thorbahn, 63, who is the managing director at consulting company NFP, ice bathes most days for two to three minutes at 33 to 34 degrees Fahrenheit. His wife, Jana Thorbahn, 59, ice bathes, too. “The older you get, the more you want to live longer,” says Thorbahn, whose home also has a gym, sauna, red light therapy room and hot tub. “You start investing in protocols to help you be healthy.”While many cold plungers have developed their own ice bathing rituals, choosing everything from their preferred water temperatures to time limits, Dr. Susanna Søberg, a Danish PhD metabolic scientist and founder of the Soeberg Institute, is one of the world’s experts on the health benefits of cold immersion, which she has been studying for nine years.In 2021, Søberg published research on cold exposure and hot exposure, which is called “contrast therapy” if the cold and hot exposures are performed in succession. Studying Danish winter swimmers, Søberg identified that a short plunge in cold, moving water combined with sauna use shifts the body’s nervous system and creates physiological changes, like boosting metabolism, lowering inflammation and releasing neurotransmitters that improve cognitive performance and mental health. “You are activating your whole body system,” Søberg says.In a field that hasn’t been widely studied by the medical community, Søberg has developed what she says is the only scientifically-backed cold immersion protocol for reducing stress using contrast therapy and breathing: Eleven total minutes of cold immersion combined with 57 total minutes of heat, across two to three days per week. The goal of her method is to expose the body to the smallest amount of healthy stress needed to reap health benefits. “Staying in cold water or heat longer may not be beneficial or necessary,” she says.Søberg says cold immersion carries the rare risk of cold water shock that can cause confusion or fainting, but the risk increases if a person does hyperventilating breathwork before or during cold water immersion. She also says cold plunging might not be good for people with heart disease or high blood pressure. Søberg advocates for cold plunging with others, and practicing slow, nasal breathing in the water.Contrast therapy is why Sausalito, Calif.,-based company Yardzen says most of its cold plunge projects involve saunas. Yardzen is an online landscape and home-exterior design company that works with homeowners across the U.S. The company’s co-founder and CEO Allison Messner says wellness yards—encompassing everything from cold plunges to saunas to meditation spaces to forest bathing—is one of Yardzen’s top 2023 trends.“Peak luxury is having both a cold plunge and a sauna in your yard so you can experience cold and hot therapy,” Messner says.Tobias Lawry, 51, and his wife, Christine Lawry, 51, live in a three-bedroom 1963 Midcentury Modern house in Dana Point, Calif. They purchased it in October 2018. Between July 2021 and October 2022, they worked with architect Chris Light, designer Frank Berry and builder Crawford Custom Homes to renovate their 3,000-square-foot house to honor its original period intention while modernizing it. This included turning a bedroom into a wellness room, which opens into a backyard with a pool, sauna and Blue Cube cold plunge.The Lawrys, who run an estate-management and concierge services company called LPM, keep their Blue Cube at 47 degrees Fahrenheit. They typically cold plunge in the evening and on weekend mornings.Stephen Garten in Austin also has a tricked-out wellness yard: In addition to his Blue Cube, he has a barrel sauna from Almost Heaven Saunas, which are manufactured in West Virginia and start around $7,500. He also has a stock tank pool from Cowboy Pools, an Austin-based company that has pool packages starting around $2,000.He was inspired to create a backyard oasis where he and his fiancée, Katie Snyder, can have friends over. “It’s wellness,” Garten says, “but it’s entertainment too.”", "Published_Date": "2023-06-01T17:37:48+05:30"},

Palka Arora Chopra, Personal Finance Experts suggests that a strategic approach to incorporating hybrid mutual funds in a balanced portfolio revolves around diversification across asset classes.“Allocate a portion to equity-oriented hybrids for growth potential and debt-oriented hybrids for stability. These funds protect against risk by combining the higher returns of equities with the risk-averse characteristics of debt, resulting in lower volatility than investing only in stocks,” said Palka Arora ChopraHybrid funds artfully blend equity and debt, allowing investors to reap the dual benefits of growth and stability in one basket. ;“The key is allocating a higher ratio to equity when markets are bullish while increasing debt allocation during volatility. This dynamic rebalancing helps participate in upside potential during market rallies while minimizing losses when headwinds strike,” said Ashish Aggarwal, Director, of Acube Ventures.Also Read: These four small-cap schemes gave over 70% returns in just one year. Do you own any?“The correlation between stocks and bonds is low, so hybrid funds tend to do well when pure stock funds struggle in bear markets. Stocks and debt instruments usually move in opposite directions. This is because when the stock market goes up, investors move money from debt into stocks, which increases the value of the stocks. Conversely, during periods of volatility in stock markets, investors turn to debt to protect their capital while generating stable income,” said Palka Arora ChopraIdeally, maintain a 60:40 allocation ratio for an optimal risk-return profile. Additionally, diversify across categories – conservative, balanced, and aggressive hybrids – to multiply growth engines within the fund while mitigating concentration risk. Use systematic transfer plans to steadily invest in dips, suggested Ashish Aggarwal.With prudent selection and tactical asset allocation, hybrid funds enable investors to sail market cycles on a balanced portfolio smoothly, he added.Investors should choose appropriate funds and regularly review and rebalance to maintain the desired asset allocation based on risk tolerance and investment goals.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts, and not of Mint.

Consequently, assets under management (AUM) have experienced significant growth. In response to this trend, certain mutual fund houses have taken proactive measures to restrict lump sum or one-time investments, aiming to safeguard investor interests. Recognising the importance of investor protection, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has articulated its concerns and urged mutual funds’ asset management companies (AMCs) to adopt preemptive measures to ensure investor protection and market stability.On why Mutual Fund houses are limiting lump sum investments in their smallcap fund, Gurmeet Singh Chawla, Director, Master Capital Services Ltd. said, “In such a scenario high volatility, limited free float, and events like elections add to the risk factors and the fund manager prefers to restrict investing larger amounts in the form of lump sums while continuing with the systematic investment and systematic transfer plan.”“The root cause of this concern is high valuation of small-cap stocks and large inflow in small-cap mutual funds. The Nifty SmallCap 100 index has already given more than 70% return in 1 year, and we have seen the valuation of some stocks grow to 3-4 times in 1 year only. Now small-cap valuation has come at a dangerously high level,” said Ravi Singhal, CEO, of GCL BrokingMarket regulator Sebi has directed mutual funds to conduct internal stress tests focusing on small-cap stocks. This initiative aims to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to accommodate significant outflows in the event of a market downturn. Typically, small-cap stocks exhibit low levels of free float market shares. Consequently, any substantial outflow can elevate the impact cost, potentially resulting in losses for investors.“Both the small-cap and mid-cap segments are in an overbought zone with high euphoria around them. Fund managers are finding fewer reasonable opportunities to invest in. At the same time, the AUM of these schemes has increased heavily and fund managers are finding it difficult to invest in reasonably valued stocks. As a result, restricting fresh inflow is a prudent choice if they are not finding enough opportunities to invest into,” said Mukesh Kochar, national head of wealth, AUM Capital.Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company (AMC) has announced restrictions on lump sum investments in its small-cap funds, effective from March 4, 2024. Similarly, Nippon India Life Asset Management declared last year that it would no longer accept lump sum investments into the Nippon India Small Cap Fund. Additionally, Tata Mutual Fund announced in July last year that it would cease accepting lump sum investments and switch-in investments in Tata Small Cap Fund.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts, and not of Mint.

Trail commission refers to a fee that mutual funds pay their distributors as long as those who bought MF units stay invested.Amfi said that asset management companies (AMCs) should not offer any incentive including gifts, gift vouchers or any form of entertainment.“Appropriate disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of registration, shall be taken against any distributor found not adhering to the aforesaid guidelines,” Amfi said.AMCs can continue to provide training to distributors for knowledge and skill development; however, the participants should not be selected on the basis of any sales target or loyalty programme. Also, this should be conducted in a central and logistically convenient location in India and not in exotic tourist destinations.Sometime ago, there were media reports of some AMCs offering training in locations like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands for achieving targets in selling some systematic investment plans.All trail commissions should be paid in monetary terms and disclosed on the AMC’s website and in half-yearly consolidated account statements. Trail commissions based on distributors achieving a certain volume are allowed, with the condition that it is paid post accrual (and not upfronted) and should come from the respective scheme’s account only.Distributors should only pay trail commissions to their sub-distributors and such payments should be in monetary terms.Amfi said that MF distributors can conduct training programmes for their employees or sub-distributors with reasonable expense and in a convenient/central location in India. There will be relaxations to this in case a programme is being run to recognize employees/sub-distributors for performance across regulated financial products. However, this should be reviewed by the distributor’s compliance officer to ensure that it’s not used to mis-sell mutual funds.", "Published_Date": "2024-03-05T23:17:55+05:30"},

These funds have emerged as a beacon for investors looking to diversify their portfolios across different asset classes. With at least three asset classes in their investment mandate and a minimum allocation of 10% to each, these funds offer a blend of equity, debt, gold, and sometimes even more exotic investments like silver, REITs, InvITs, and overseas equities.The Taxation Shift and Its ImpactA significant shift in the taxation policy, as amended in the Finance Act, of 2023, has played a pivotal role in spotlighting hybrid funds, particularly multi-asset allocation funds. ;The capital gains from mutual fund investments, especially those with less than 35% in domestic equities, are now taxed according to the investor’s tax slab, removing the long-favoured long-term capital gains (LTCG) and indexation benefits for debt mutual funds initiated post-April 1, 2023. This change has nudged investors towards hybrid funds, seeking tax efficiency alongside investment diversity.Also Read: Small caps cause inflows into equity mutual funds to spike 23% in February: AMFI dataWhy Consider MAFs?Multi-asset allocation funds have been pitched as a less volatile option compared to their aggressive hybrid equity counterparts, offering indexation benefits if the equity allocation lies between 35 to 65%. This proposition, coupled with the recent tax changes, makes these funds an attractive choice for those seeking diversified, tax-efficient investment avenues.Last year we witnessed the launch of nine multi-asset allocation funds by different fund houses. This influx can be seen as a testament to the growing investor interest and the fund houses’ efforts to fill portfolio gaps or cater to high demand.Portfolio Construction and Investment ConsiderationsIt’s essential to recognize that these funds come in various flavours, each with its unique blend of investments. Some might lean heavily towards international markets or include commodities, adding a layer of diversity to your portfolio. This variety means that as an investor, a thorough examination of each fund’s composition is necessary.Introducing new funds that may seem attractive at first glance. However, diving into these waters requires a clear understanding of what each fund entails and the risks associated with them. This is especially crucial for those just starting their investment, where the allure of novelty should be balanced with caution and due diligence.For individual investors, particularly those exploring investments without the guidance of a financial advisor, the wisdom lies in moderation. Committing to a single multi-asset fund and keeping it to a reasonable proportion of your overall portfolio—ideally between 15 and 20%—can offer a balanced approach to risk and reward. Conversely, those who have the benefit of personalized financial advice might find their paths better illuminated by strategies that are tailored to their specific risk appetites and financial goals.Also Read: What are the types of equity mutual funds?

However, it’s essential to approach these funds with caution, understanding their inherent risks and ensuring they align with your investment objectives and risk tolerance. While these funds offer a mix of growth, income, and diversification, they should not be chosen solely for potential tax benefits.Thorough research, perhaps guided by professional advice, is key to making informed investment decisions in this innovative fund category.

Large volumes mean that sound database management becomes extremely important.It is also safe to assume that as businesses grow and security concerns rise, the landscape of data storage and management is only going to get more complex, and issues like poor application performance and compliance risk will keep surfacing.Oracle’s recently-launched Oracle Cloud integrates applied machine learning to deliver self-driving, self-tuning, self-recovering, self-scaling, and self-securing administration—without human intervention—resulting in streamlined operations, more efficient consumption of resources, and higher security and reliability. Let’s take a look at how this can potentially help businesses overcome several key database management challenges.1. ScalabilityFor modern businesses and organisations, the ability to react quickly to ever-changing business environment, trends, and technological forces is extremely essential. Maybe a decade ago, businesses had the luxury to take months or even years for their development cycles. But it isn’t so anymore. The elasticity of database management systems must cater to these needs. The Oracle Autonomous Database is the world’s first fully automated cloud database platform powered by machine learning. And its computing and storage capacity are instantly elastic. It renders businesses the capability to scale up or down instantly, with no downtime.Simply put, if you need more storage, you can scale up instantly; if you need less, you can scale them down, and then restart as and when there is demand for it. 2. CybersecurityA recent report by cyber risk management advisor Coalfire suggests that large enterprises are the least prepared of all companies against cyber crime, despite having greater budgets and resources. In general, the vulnerability of businesses to cyber attacks has increased manifold, and there are more sources that cyber threats emanate from.Managing the security of databases, therefore, has become a huge challenge. Security operations centres are flooded with data and events, and they are constantly trying to correlate and distil large amounts of data to help identify potential risks. Today, technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms assist security operations centres to manage configurations, and monitor who has access to what resources. These technologies are also helpful in encrypting data and protecting IT assets.The Oracle Autonomous Database is more secure than a manually operated database, because it protects itself rather than having to wait for an available administrator. This applies to defences against both external and internal attacks.It is capable of automatically encrypting all data to provide a secure configuration and prevent data access from outside the database. It applies security updates to protect against external attacks, automatically. The Oracle Autonomous Database is also capable of leveraging security technologies like the Oracle Database Vault (which separates duties to make sure data is not visible to the people who administer your systems) and Oracle Data Masking (which keeps developers and QA personnel from seeing your data).3. CostOne of the biggest advantages of the Oracle Autonomous Database is cost efficiency, as it reduces the amount of labour required and also cuts down on administrative costs. It can cut administration costs up to 80% with full automation of operations and tuning, and cut runtime costs up to 90% by billing only for resources needed at any given time. It can eliminate human labour to provision, secure, monitor, backup, recover, troubleshoot, and tune databases. All these put together can reduce database maintenance tasks, which in turn reduce costs.Additionally, it is also easy for developers to use, and it will free up administrators form the mundane and tedious operational tasks, and they will actually have the opportunity to use their time better, and focus on innovation.4.Tuning, Troubleshooting, and PatchingDatabases used for mission-critical activities, or for enterprise data analysis, have a set of special challenges of their own. Databases that support enterprise data warehouses tend to become really big in size as they support complex queries with many nested joins. At the same time, they are expected to deliver quick response on the queries. Database administrators are also in the constant process of trying various techniques to boost performance, creating and dropping indexes, changing data storage allocation parameters, and defining and redefining partitions. In addition, they are also monitoring the database for problems and performing preventative maintenance. Then there are the processes involved in applying software upgrades and patches, which are not just tedious, but also highly disruptive and take a significant amount of timeAll these challenges can be dealt with by using the Oracle Autonomous Database. It incorporates machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance performance tuning and prevent application outages. It can manage a wide variety of tasks that are usually handled by database administrators.Finally, the fully automated database cloud service is self-tuning and preconfigured for automated patches and upgrades. This means that any possibility of manual errors is eliminated. For organizations looking for cloud database offerings, and a fully managed database service from a proven database vendor, Oracle’s Autonomous Database can be the answer.The Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud is just one step on a multi-step journey. It allows businesses to simplify their IT infrastructure and minimize capital investments by utilizing Oracle Cloud services for data management, applications, and business intelligence.

While CIOs and CISOs can take care of the technological aspects and, in some cases, compliance, the business risk which is increasingly becoming apparent after the emergence of endless breaches in large conglomerates, can best be understood and managed in the boardroom. Cybersecurity Ventures - Cybercrime Report 2017, which forecasts cyber crime losses to reach $6 trillion by 2021 from $3 trillion in 2015 – gives enough reasons to consider cyber security a business risk and states why it is imperative for boards to also rise up to the challenge.Why boards are not fully empowered We know that regulators and shareholders have already mounted pressure on company boards to report breaches and material loss in their filings. The boards of many banks, credit rating agencies, e-commerce, and healthcare companies have swung into action - they regularly discuss, review, and plan cyber risks in their meetings. However, their numbers are small. More companies need to embrace this thinking; the perception that cyber security is a technology issue needs to done away with as soon as possible. To get on this bandwagon, a huge challenge lies in the lack of a robust mechanism that allows the board to oversee cyber security. Boards traditionally like to assess everything on measurable metrics (performance rating points). While these metrics are present for other functions, for cyber security there aren’t any.For a board the only source of information is the audit committee assessment, which only has a historic view. It does not guide it to take action and help it to plan ahead. On the other hand, to maintain real time supervision, boards need to know how many threats were detected in a defined timeframe, how were they responded to, how breach attempts were handled, how many system outages were encountered, in what time the company recovered from the outages, how many system gaps/vulnerabilities were detected and fixed, and if the company chalked out a plan to fend off future unknown threats. Since there are no measurable metrics in cyber security, this information remains unavailable to them today.What can boards do?In that case, what can boards do? Probably the only way to address the regulatory scrutiny and to play the role of a guardian in the true sense of the word, boards can resort to asking management the right questions. While boards will never be expected to know everything related to cyber risk, the questions they ask can give them a macro view. Here are some examples:Do we have the information?In response to this, the management can be asked to facilitate regular meetings with the company’s top security owner, CIO or CISO. Besides, they can engage an outside expert for additional insights on the security trends and risks. During these discussions, boards will be able to enquire about the company’s threat environment and its resistance to cyber attacks.How effective is our cyber security strategy?Boards should ask the management about the company’s comprehensive strategy for addressing data security, whether it is effective and whether the programme includes innovative technologies to monitor, identify and respond to cyber threats or incidents.How do we protect sensitive information handled, stored and transmitted by third-party vendors?The company’s third parties (suppliers, contractors, service providers and others) may have access to sensitive information on the company’s network— which can result in a potential cyber security breach. Boards should understand how the company selects, vets and monitors third parties, along with how these parties protect the company’s sensitive information. They should also understand the company’s legal rights related to the third party, particularly if there is a breach.Do we have cyber insurance?The frequency and severity of cyber attacks has many companies considering cyber insurance. Boards need to know about the company’s cyber insurance policy (if purchased) and how the cyber insurance market is changing, particularly as underwriters become more sophisticated.How do we stay current in the threat landscape?It’s important that boards ask what their company is doing to learn from others to improve its own resilience and cyber security.Do we have a tested cyber incident response plan?A security breach can cause serious damage to a company’s reputation and financial position. Boards should discuss the company’s incident response plan with the management - what it entails regarding cyber security, how the management tests the plan and if it could be improved upon to be made more effective.Reporting cyber securityWhile putting pressure on the management for cyber security resilience is important, companies are required to adopt a board reporting framework for cyber security, which is based on global standards and incorporates five core functions - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. This will give boards the desired insights – like the number of threats detected, vulnerabilities addressed, breaches handled and the strategy for unknown future threats.A board reporting framework, which is essential for handling and addressing cyber security challenges, has to have four key elements: Threat horizon: It should include information about the threat landscape, how it is growing in sophistication as well as complexity and how it challenges their business. Industry challenges: It should include an overview of the key cyber security trends, threats/breaches/vulnerabilities overall, to their sector and to their company. Besides, it should note what the industry and their competitors are doing to fight these threats. Regulatory requirements: It should incorporate information about changing regulations like GDPR, the Data Protection Bill, RBI guidelines, etc. Technology evolution: At the same time, it needs to be able to update systems regularly as the technology or threat landscape evolves. ConclusionBoard members are becoming increasingly answerable to regulators, investors and customers. Adopting a cyber security board reporting framework empowers them with the thorough insights needed to defend companies from external and internal threats and the steps that need to be taken to ensure the safety of digital assets. Just to reiterate: in the digital age, cyber threats are not a technology issue but a business risk.This article has been authored by Sivarama Krishnan, Leader – Cyber Security, PwC India.

From retail to hospitality and even banking the cloud has brought businesses closer to their customers. Powering this transformation are a complex and ever-growing set of networking software which receive data from multiple branches and relay it to the central servers of a company.However, this proliferation of cloud services is not without its own challenges. Due to the increasing number of mobile and Internet of Things (Iot) devices, bandwidth requirements have increased while the IT teams which run and maintain these networks have shrunk. Routing traffic from various branches to an organization’s private data center is no longer feasible, not to mention the additional management and security pain points that comes from having enterprise workloads on public cloud services. To better manage remote networks, varying client inputs and in-office data, businesses need to think in terms of an end-to-end network which runs these functions through a single platform.In such situations, deploying a software-defined branch (SD-Branch) network can help simplify operations and lower costs without compromising the flexibility of scaling up to meet future business demands. SD-Branch networks merge networks and services that were traditionally managed by different stacks of software. This reduces the clutter of virtual LANS and access control mechanisms scattered across multiple network devices.High end luxury retailer Vera Wang is an organization that is facing the challenge of building a distributed infrastructure for its stores as it scales its operations. The company has used software provided by Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, to provide non-technical staff at the branch a plug-and-play experience that eliminates the need for manual onsite configuration.“We need to get stores up and running quickly, and maximize our WAN availability and efficiency,” said Stewart Ebrat, CIO for Vera Wang.Here’s how SD-Branch networks can help you manage your business better:1. Reduce the clutter: Core company services are no longer run through data centers. This creates the headache of multiple platforms communicating within the business. By using a single platform that supports SD-WAN (Wide Area Network), routing, integrated security and LAN/Wi-Fi functions, SD-Branch technology allows these different systems to be managed centrally. SD-Branch also promises to reduce the need for buying specialized hardware for each branch by deploying software on consolidated hardware.2. Operational agility: SD-Branches can be deployed as and when required, without the trouble of setting up dedicated hardware and software as well as putting in the required management controls specific to that branch. Unlike traditional WAN deployments, where bandwidth may be lying unused, this software uses virtualization to use existing bandwidth efficiently.The latest software like Aruba Central’s Cloud management platform provides a single pane of glass for wireless, wired and WAN management, enhancing IT’s ability to proactively see what is happening in each branch. An added benefit is that IT can quickly implement new services and network changes across large distributed environments.3. Save money on IT: Perhaps the most compelling argument for this technology is that it will reduce the need for tech teams to visit each branch individually to setup the IT infrastructure which will result in significant savings. Also the cost of IT support and maintenance contracts will decrease as fewer vendors need to be involved. IT administrators can control and adjust all branch network and security functions using a centralized management console.4. Better security: Employees are now accessing company networks from different locations without being in office. This lack of awareness is a big concern for enterprises which use cloud services like Office 365. IoT devices get connected without the knowledge of the IT administrators. This can lead to users sometimes bypassing security controls set for the branch. Aruba’s SD-Branch solution has role-based access security that allows dynamic segmentation of devices and traffic.To solve security vulnerabilities outside the branch perimeter, Aruba has expanded its security partnership with Check Point Software Technologies and Palo Alto Networks to provide cloud-based firewall and advanced threat protection functionality to secure sensitive traffic heading for public Internet-bound destinations.

You are losing a hefty amount if committing either of these seven mistakes", "Author": "Sangeeta Ojha", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/sangeeta-ojha", "Content": "Mutual fund investors alert! The equity market has attracted many investors, most opting for investment through various mutual fund schemes across small, mid, large, flexi, and balanced categories. However, there are common mistakes that investors tend to make when investing in equity mutual schemes. Livemint spoke to personal finance experts about some of these major mistakes.1) Investing without setting financial goalsYour investments should always be tied to specific financial goals. These goals could include education and marriage for your children, purchasing a house, taking a foreign vacation, or planning retirement. Wealth creation can be a valid objective if you don’t have a specific goal.“The product for investments will differ depending on the tenure of the goal, as well as its criticality and flexibility. A foreign trip or house purchase can wait, but not the education or marriage of your children. Since one has to move the accumulated corpus in equity to a safer product as the goal nears, this cannot be done unless the investments and goals are linked,” said tax and investment expert Balwant Jain.2) Chasing returns rather than financial goalsThis refers to making investment decisions based solely on the potential for high returns without considering how those returns align with one’s broader financial objectives.\"Instead of focusing on achieving specific financial milestones or objectives, investors may prioritise investments that promise quick or high returns. This approach can be risky because it often involves taking on more risk than necessary or investing in assets that may not align with one’s long-term financial needs,\" said SEBI registered tax and investment expert Jitendra Solanki.Also Read | Best Mutual Funds to invest in 2024: Top-performing large, mid, small, multi, flexi-cap funds in one year. Check here3) Trading in mutual fundsIt involves frequently buying and selling fund units to book regular profit, rather than hold onto investments for the long term.\"While trading can generate short-term gains, it may not be conducive to long-term wealth accumulation. Constantly buying and selling mutual fund units can result in higher transaction costs, taxes, and potential capital gains liabilities,\" said Pankaj Mathpal, MD & CEO at Optima Money Managers4) Trying to time the marketPankaj Mathpal notes that many investors tend to panic when the market corrects. They often withdraw their investments and stop their ongoing systematic investment plans (SIPs) for fear of further decline.Also Read: Top 10 mutual funds for SIP to invest in 20245)Non-diversificationWhile making investments, one should diversify across asset classes, such as equity, debt, and gold. \"If you follow the principle of asset allocation and rebalancing periodically, you can certainly maximise your returns. So if one does not follow the asset allocation, even one major correction in the asset class may wipe out the profits and result in losses, and different asset classes do not always move in the same direction,\" explained Balwant Jain.Solanki pointed out the absence of asset allocation, with investors solely focusing on a single asset class that appears to be performing well. They shift from one asset to another class when the markets are high.6) Expecting unrealistic returnsThe recent rally in the Indian stock market has led people to believe that equity can always provide exceptional returns. Balwant Jian emphasised the importance of being realistic about the returns generated by mutual fund investments. According to him, equity mutual funds should ideally provide around inflation + 6% return in the long run, and investors should be content with that.7)Not reviewing your investmentsBalwant Jain emphasizes that reviewing your investments periodically is crucial in your investment journey. However, it’s important not to over-review. Checking the performance of your equity schemes every month and taking corrective steps can be harmful. Ideally, you should review them once a year.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts, and not of Mint.

No matter how hard you try to cope with the loss, there remains a void that is difficult to fill.One of the healthiest ways to tackle such grief is to surround yourself with happy memories—memories of the person that you can look back on and smile. You could also find solace in the beautiful life lessons and values left by the person you’ve lost. While death leaves behind heartache, love leaves a memory that no one can steal. Life goes on, and love lives on. Your loved ones are still there with you because of the things they taught you, because of the moments that they spent with you. After all, when you live the values and implement the life lessons your loved ones have taught you, you bring them back to life. You help celebrate their lives in the most magical way possible.As novelist Carson McCullers once said, “How can the dead be truly dead when they still live in the souls of those who are left behind?”Makes sense, right? Then, perhaps, you can share your story and that of your beloved by taking part in the Memory Project powered by HDFC Life. This initiative explores the lives of people who are dealing with the deaths of their near and dear ones—through objects or fond memories associated with the departed.On April 28, an event was organized in Mumbai that brought together all those who had been a part of the first edition of the project. Through music, poetry, and a letter-writing activity, the participants remembered their loved ones who had passed away.The leading insurer returns with the second edition whose theme is ‘Memories through Values’. Some of the people connected with the Memory Project this time around are musician Aarifah Rebello, comedian Neville Shah, rapper Prabhdeep Singh, actor Divya Dutta, and writer Ankita Chawla. Each of them reminisces about the special moments they’ve spent with their departed loved ones, and reveals the memories that they’ve carried forward.HDFC Life is organizing an event at the British Council in New Delhi on September 22.

A question that many brands have been asking for the past decade or so. The generation of digital natives, who are social media savvy, and like personalised experiences, are not very easy to please. They are also the generation that has changed the way brands go about their business.Although, as soon as brands had somewhat figured out millennials, they now have the Generation Z to deal with, those who have recently become adults and whose purchasing power will continue to grow significantly. The millennials and Generation Z are also the people who matter when it comes to phones. And they are particular and fickle, to say the least. They are used to easy access to everything, from food to cabs, and entertainment. For them, smartphones are not a luxury, but a part of their lives, a way of conducting their everyday business, while staying in touch with people.So how does a brand connect with these people? What does it take for smartphones to reach out to these generations of users who won’t settle for anything less than perfect, especially when it comes to technology? It is particularly difficult at a time when perhaps every new model that comes up is the same, in terms of size, its operating system, camera, design, and battery life. There are very few brands that are able to pass the toughest test – that of appealing to these next-gen users. Most recently, Chinese handset brand Realme has managed to pass this test, and with flying colours. So how did it navigate that road, especially being an extremely new brand?Realme 1 is a dual-sim phone powered by a 2GHz octa-core processor, with 128GB of internal storage, which is expandable to 256GB; and, all of this starting at  ₹ 10,990 only! This slick, good-looking phone boasted of a 4.4 rating and was the top-rated mobile phone in Amazon’s bestsellers rankings.It was a mega hit with the youth. The phone had all that any millennial or Gen Z buyer needs—a powerful camera, top-notch video quality for Snapchats, Instagram videos, Facebook lives, great editing capabilities, enough memory, and a good battery life to last them through all of these adventures.The new Realme 2 is even better with a 6.2-inch IPS LCD panel that takes up 88.8% of the body, which has a HD+ resolution. This version also betters the UI with ColorOS 5.1 based on Android Oreo 8.1. The animations and icons are better, and it even switches to a driving or a do not disturb mode. One of its very interesting features is that it uses machine learning to optimise power management. The best thing about this version is that the battery can last up to two days.When Realme 1 was launched in May this year, it garnered praise from all quarters for its design and affordability. Realme 1 offered a 6-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 1080 pixels x 2160 pixels at a PPI of 403 pixels per inch. The phone has great picture clarity and resolution of a 13-megapixel primary camera and an 8-megapixel front camera.Making a markBoth the Realme phones have made a mark in a very short span of time.Sample this: Realme 2 sold 370,000 units within 10 minutes across two sales on e-commerce platform Flipkart, setting the platform’s record for sales of a single mobile phone product.This kind of success is based both on the quality and features the product offers, and the appeal as a forward-looking, youth-focussed brand it has for young customers.Take the battery life for instance. Even the best smartphones in the market today on an average have batteries that last them through a day. So, for a prolific consumer of media, texting, and other services in the span of a day, a two-day battery life is a blessing.Realme phones are also great for gaming enthusiasts. It features the Realme Game Space, which assists in lag-free gaming. Game Space has features like gaming acceleration, network protection, and no disturbance.As a brand, Realme has managed to connect with its customers as it identifies itself as a brand for young people. Realme is a brand that shares their enthusiasm, optimism, and promise. It also recognises their belief in the possibility to create, acknowledges their breakthroughs, believes in change, is proud of their growth and success, admires their resilience, and wants them to forge their own path.Combining a youthful design and competitive specs, Realme’s innovative products have attracted millions of users, making it a real threat to other international brands. Next, it will be available in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.The youth connectRealme is a brand of the young, by the young, and for the young. To drive home this message, the smartphone manufacturer recently came out with a filmwhich features three youngsters living in New York City. One of them is an Indian boy, who, despite his educational commitments, chooses to follow his passion for boxing. Overall, the film captures the sentiments of the young and the restless—those who always find themselves at the threshold of infinite possibilities, but who are never afraid to dream. The young are all those who settle for nothing but the best; they are never hesitant to be their ‘real’ selves. In short, they are ‘proud to be young’!Realme, therefore, believes in churning out products which resonate with this generation. Both its phones pack in a powerful punch—in terms of performance as well as style.Today, Realme is one of the fastest growing smartphone brands in India, with the brand gaining 4th position in this fastest growing online smartphone market in just 30 days. Sample this: Realme 2 sold 2 lakh units on 1st sale and 1.7 lakh units during its second sale, successfully completing the sales of 1 million handsets!

Well, you shouldn’t be.When you are resting, your vital organs are hard at work, thereby releasing heat in the process. And certain mattresses are notorious for absorbing this heat, going on to rob you of your sleep! Therefore, you need to invest in the right kind of mattress, as sleep deprivation has been linked to various health problems, including high blood pressure, cardiac ailments, obesity, and diabetes.No more sleepless nightsYou might think that the solution to your sweaty nights lies in cool gel or gel-infused mattresses, but it is not quite so. Cool gel technology works for only a brief period of time. Although your mattress is initially cool to touch, it soon heats up!Instead, how about opting for a mattress that ensures that you feel neither too hot nor too cold throughout the night?This kind of mattress employs the Heat Absorption Technology (TM) (HAT), which was engineered for NASA to help astronauts adapt to the extreme temperature conditions in space. The mattresses are composed of Outlast ® Phase Change Materials (PCM), and work in two ways—when in contact with a hot body, they absorb the excess heat; and when in contact with a cold body, they release heat to warm it up.According to this study, such mattresses can reduce sweat by 48%!Remember the times when you fight with your partner over the AC remote or the blanket because one of you feels warm while the other doesn’t? You can bid goodbye to these, as mattresses that come with HAT technology adapt to each person’s body temperature!Further, reduced moisture on your mattresses increases their durability.Duroflex is the only brand in India whose mattresses employ such a technology. Hence, its mattresses are cooler than regular ones. Opt for one such mattress, and enjoy a cool, sweat-free sleep!To know more about Duroflex’s HAT-enabled mattresses, please click here.", "Published_Date": "2018-10-05T13:29:00+05:30"},

If we haven’t met, my name is Mr. Money Mustache. I’m the freaky financial magician who retired along with a lovely wife at age 30 in order to start a family, as well as start living a great life. We did this on two normal salaries with no lottery winnings or Silicon Valley buyout windfalls…”Now, before you dismiss these lines as fictional or fake, here’s something to pique your interest: this is an extract from a well-known blog (1) run by US-based Peter Adeney, who actually retired from his job as a software engineer in 2005 at age 30, albeit with enough money to last him and his family for a lifetime! He retired early to live a frugal, yet badass life! So, how did Mr. Money Mustache do it?Both he and his wife saved 50% or more of their incomes every month (at the time of their retirement, they had amassed nearly $600,000 in investments); they cut down on irrational spending; they never incurred debt; and they found cheaper substitutes for nearly everything. You can truly lead a life better than your current one—that could cost 50% to 75% less!Interestingly, Peter is not the only one to have embraced this kind of lifestyle. Across the world, more and more young professionals are focusing on the goal of achieving financial independence and retiring early, popularly known as FIRE, by rethinking their relationship with money. There are forums (2), camps, and retreats (3) on FIRE, and there is also a FIRE subreddit (4) that has more than 400,000 subscribers! One of the obvious reasons for people to be doing this is that they don’t wish to keep working till the age of 60. To delve further into the principles behind FIRE, we spoke to a few millennials who are part of this movement. Read on to know how they are going about it!Uddipta Ghosh, Digital Marketer, 31, KolkataPlans to retire by: 40Targeted corpus: Rs. 3 crore in both liquid (shares, mutual funds, FDs) and digital assets (online businesses, blogs)Tenets followed: Saving 60%-70% of monthly income; not owning a house or a car; eating out not more than 3-4 times a yearPlans after retiring early: Travelling the world; watching live FIFA World Cup matches; engaging in social work.Pro-tip: Don’t fall into the EMI trap; don’t buy something simply because everyone around you is buying it.“Life is not only about working day and night; there are so many other things that I wish to do when I am 40 or 50, without having to worry about money. And this is what propelled me to become a FIRE devotee. I started out by saving nearly 60%-70% of my income every month, and have been following this trend ever since. Approximately 85% of my investments are allocated towards mutual funds, while the rest are towards Public Provident Funds (PPFs) and fixed deposits. My wife, Monisha, is supporting me in my efforts.I took up the FIRE philosophy also because I don’t want to be a victim of lifestyle diseases; I have seen employees of many corporate organizations getting totally burned out by the time they are 45 or 50, which is really saddening. You sacrifice your health, your family life, and yet, you’re not happy. However, it’s important to have a passive source of income once you retire. No matter how much you save, it’s never sufficient to take care of all your necessities; investments which are locked in for a long period of time help.”Shreyansh Jain, Business Analyst, 26, DelhiAims to retire by: 50Targeted corpus: Rs. 2-3 crore in liquid assetsTenets followed: Saving 35%-40% of monthly income; not owning a house or a car; never taking loans or using credit cards; minimizing meals eaten outside.Plans after retiring early: Establishing a dog shelter; investing in small businesses.Pro-tip: Don’t buy things that you don’t need; take public transport as much as you can; don’t opt for loans or credit cards; invest as soon as you are paid.“The FIRE movement may have caught on recently, but I have been a firm believer in retiring early for quite some time now. I don’t want to keep working forever because my job is very stressful. I want to be super healthy even when I am 55 or 60. Frankly, at my age, it’s not easy as it is sounds. So I try and save wherever I can. I take public transport, live in a small house so that I have to pay less rent, and make only one or two big purchases a year. I also don’t eat out as often as my peers. It was my father who taught me to be careful about money. I would see him putting away a portion of his income every month before spending even a penny, and I do so, too. I set aside nearly 35%-40% of my salary towards PPFs, SIPs, and Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs). The good thing about ULIPs is that they provide investment as well as insurance benefits.My advice to fellow FIRE followers would be to not lose hope and invest as much as they can. But, at the same time, don’t be too hard on yourself!”Pardeep Goyal, blogger and content marketing consultant, 33, ChandigarhAims to retire by: 40Targeted corpus: No such targetTenets followed: Living in a rented house; investing heavily in term insurance, PPF, and digital assets.Plans after retiring early: Engaging in community service; providing mentorship to small businesses; investing in the education and healthcare sectors.Pro-tip: Invest in both digital and traditional banking instruments; find a passive source of income; opt for long-term investment plans; don’t invest in an asset unless you have full knowledge about it.“My friends tease me by the name of ‘Kanjoos Baniya’. I acquired this moniker back in college because of my habit of saving money on every item that I purchase. But I don’t mind. I am proud of who I am today.I don’t believe in retiring from a hectic job at the age of 60, only to die in a hospital a few years later. Instead, I believe in retiring early, with enough money for the purpose of community development. How will I achieve this? I will never buy a house, simply because I don’t want to pay a hefty EMI every month. My wife, Neha, and I are very happy in the rented house that we live in. With this move, we have saved enough to fund our travel and other leisurely activities. We call this our own ‘financial freedom’.I also learnt the importance of money when I failed at my startup in 2014 and lost all my savings. In 2015, I started a blog (5) called CashOverflow, where I regularly guide people on becoming financially independent. Neha is my business partner. Term insurance plans, PPFs, and SIPs are my preferred modes of investment. I also have investments in a couple of websites and digital marketing assets.”If you are a FIRE enthusiast like Shreyansh or Pardeep, and are looking to get one step closer to your dream, you need to be an uber-saver. This means you have to save 50% or more of your income. Now, this isn’t impossible. If you closely track your spending, invest wisely in financial instruments like ULIPs, and rethink your relationship with money, you can become a die-hard FIRE adherent too! If you think about it, a ULIP offers you the twin benefits of life insurance and savings at market-linked returns, as well as the flexibility to switch between your fund options. There are several insurers today like HDFC Life that enable you to invest in ULIPs. That’s not all. You can also enjoy tax benefits by opting for these policies.Even if retiring early isn’t your thing, or if you’re in a job that pays peanuts, you can still take away a lot of practical tips from the FIRE lifestyle that’ll help you save and manage your money well.Links:1.http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/2.http://www.early-retirement.org/forums/3.https://www.gocurrycracker.com/chautauqua-2015-una-fiesta-ecuatoriana/4.https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence5.https://www.cashoverflow.in/", "Published_Date": "2018-10-05T17:29:21+05:30"},

Naturally, no enterprise, big or small, wants the latter. An important aspect of avoiding being disrupted and not fading into oblivion is to plan a successful digital transformation. In fact, digital transformation is not an option anymore; it is what organisations need for survival. The question is – are organisations ready to take the big leap and prepare their businesses for the present and the future? A new report by Accenture says that only 6% of C-level executives say they’ve successfully managed to embrace new businesses activities without hesitation.“Embracing new businesses decisively is a challenge for most companies. Many cling to legacy products, services and brands, or have outdated technology,” the report says. In all of this, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is the most likely member of the C-suite to take ownership of digital transformation. CIOs are in a position of advantage when it comes to digital transformation, as it is one role in the c-suite that touches every department of the organisation. They can, in fact, drive the digital transformation and use existing skills in a new way and create the best environment for the business to succeed.Here are key factors that organisations and CIOs should keep in mind before embarking on the transformation to the new.1. Building investment capacityBusinesses today understand that if they need to thrive in the digital age, they have to take on the disruptive forces. But the question is – how? This is where companies need the wise pivot, a strategy for the digital age that can help them pursue new growth opportunities without abandoning their core business.Companies that pivot wisely are the ones that transform the core business to drive up investment capacity, helping the business become more competitive, and improving the cost structure to drive flexibility in the core model, and creating investment capacity to repurpose other parts of the business. They need investment capacity to scale new businesses as well as reinvigorate the core.Companies can build greater investment capacity by revitalizing their core business. They have to make transformative choices like strategic cost-reduction, consolidation of tangible assets and divestment of non-core businesses. They need to fine-tune their existing business activities by streamlining assets.Also, companies with profitable core businesses are more likely to generate and sustain strong investment capacity.2. Driving incremental growth in the core businessA lot of businesses skip over this part, but driving incremental growth in the core business is one of the goals of changing into the new. For instance, a company whose core business is retail can start by improving the search functionality its website, making the mobile experience better, and enhancing the checkout information. Now this may mean realigning the backend with all these new functionalities and requirements. This is where some of the investment capacity must be used. All these moves will drive efficiencies in the core business and eventually result in cost savings.Driving incremental growth in the core business can begin with digital basics like digital marketing, analytics and web interactions, which are all ways of getting closer to customers in the core business.3. Scaling the newThe world has changed so much. Traditionally companies have been reluctant of entering new businesses, and when they did, it was done slowly and gradually. But today about 70 percent of companies generate less than one-half of their revenues and profits from new business activities. Now, to get there, companies have to be in a constant state of change.And for that they need a constant flow of new ideas. Most businesses can identify new businesses that are closer to their core area, but scaling them is difficult. They need to build innovation architecture inside the business that is reflective of the different levels of maturity of those businesses. They can work with startups and innovation centres, which can help them commercialise these new businesses and ideas, and help them figure how they can go to mass market scale in a short period of time.A focussed strategy will help these organisations identify relevant and promising innovations, prototype them, and test them quickly. This will also help them go commercial faster than the competition. 4. Creating synergiesNow this is the most important part, new businesses cannot come at the cost of the old. There has to be cross-selling between the new and old businesses. In fact, a truly transformed business will use the new business to reinvigorate and reshape the legacy business.Moving to new business and creating synergies will also help in ensuring that organisations are future-ready and cementing their position as future leaders in the industry. A strong collaborating network is essential for this. Problems of the future will not be solved by companies on their own, they need collaborative partnerships and joint ventures, that can be used for constant innovation, and refuelling the core business. 5. Technology isn’t everythingSure, modern technologies are at the heart of transformation, but they aren’t everything. It is not about going to the market and buying the latest technology. Rather, it is about optimising that technology to get maximum value for your business. It is also about creating the right environment for that technology to help your specific needs. This choice between new technology and the right technology can be more difficult for traditional companies that have to connect new digital applications to legacy systems that are important for the business. In such cases, companies can try a staged approach, and not just change everything at one go. While such an approach may take longer, it gives the organisation and people time to get used to a new way of working, while not disrupting everything in an instant.Accenture’s report outlines that the success stories of tomorrow will be determined by executives who know how and when to pivot wisely.“This will call for courageous decisions that enable today’s companies to: generate sufficient investment capacity by revitalizing their legacy business, then deploy that capacity to scale new businesses, while redesigning the organization to innovate more pervasively,” it concludes.So how do you prepare to pivot wisely? Start by being investment ready, innovating by design, and blending the old and the new. Find out more here. ", "Published_Date": "2018-10-15T12:00:03+05:30"},

Under the current framework, mutual funds are permitted to participate in CDS transactions only as users -to buy credit protection only to hedge the credit risk on corporate bonds held by them.Furthermore, this transaction can be undertaken by mutual funds only in the portfolio of Fixed Maturity Plans (FMP) schemes with a tenor of more than one year. In its consultation paper, the regulator has suggested to permit participation of mutual funds in CDS buying for all schemes as well as CDS selling for all schemes except overnight and liquid. ;Also Read: SEBI finds ICICI bank outreach to I-sec shareholders inappropriateThe proposal came after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on February 10, 2022, specified the revised regulatory framework for CDS to further develop the debt market in the country. The guidelines sought to provide the necessary impetus for the development of CDS market by expanding the base of protection sellers including selling of protection by all major non-bank regulated entities, MFs.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has sought comments till July on the proposal. In market parlance, CDS means a credit derivative contract in which one counterparty (protection seller) commits to pay to the other counterparty (protection buyer) in the case of a credit event and in return, the protection buyer makes periodic payments (premium) to the protection seller until the maturity of the contract or the credit event, whichever is earlier.Accordingly, ;buying a CDS is akin to buying insurance. In case any debt security on which a CDS is bought defaults, the protection seller ( seller of CDS) pays the notional amount (amount of debt security) and takes over the debt security in default.Going by the consultation paper, SEBI has suggested that mutual fund schemes should be permitted to buy CDS only to hedge their credit risk on debt securities they hold in all schemes. ;In case the protected debt security is sold, schemes should ensure that the respective CDS position is closed within 7 days of selling such protected debt security.Also Read: SEBI extends deadline for demat and mutual fund nomination.

On selling CDS, SEBI has suggested that mutual fund schemes should be permitted to sell CDS only as investors in synthetic debt securities -- ;sell CDS on a reference obligation covered with cash, Government-Securities and Treasury bills. Overnight and liquid schemes should not be permitted to sell CDS contracts.Additionally, the regulator has suggested that mutual funds should ensure a Two-way Credit Support Annex (CSA) as part of CDS contracts. The Two-way CSA decreases the counter party risk ; -- the risk that the protection seller is unable to pay, given the default on reference obligation-- since margin is kept by both sides. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-08T18:43:49+05:30"},
{"Article_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/5cATYpgqfWSaqHApXkftmK/The-Future-is-Autonomous.html", "Title": "The Future is Autonomous | Mint", "Author": "Promotional Feature, HT Brand Studio", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/promotional-feature, https://www.livemint.com/authors/ht-brand-studio", "Content": "As the digital economy becomes all-pervasive, there is a demand for everything to be adaptive, autonomous, and self-learning. In a truly digital world, there is no place for human errors, and no place either for people in repetitive and mundane tasks. The future is autonomous—and this applies to databases as well.A recent Oracle survey of database administrators (DBAs) showed that 39 percent of DBAs are managing 50 or more databases, and 95 percent of those IT professionals manually create and update these databases. Database management is reaching a tipping point.The survey also pointed out that a high proportion of DBAs say they experience some type of unplanned downtime over the course of their careers, and most of these individuals struggle to coordinate multiple management and backup tools.In such a scenario, if organisations are trying to be future-ready, how do they overcome these niggles? What do they do, and who do they trust with the future of the organisation?Oracle might be a good answer to that question. Oracle, which has been around for more than four decades, is applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to its next-generation Cloud platform services to help customers lower cost, accelerate innovation, reduce risk, and get predictive insights.Oracle Autonomous Cloud Platform services gives organisations the ability to truly transform and be future-ready. Here’s why: it is built with advanced artificial intelligence and ground breaking machine-learning algorithms, which offers self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing capabilities. Consequently, it gives CTOs more time to drive smarter innovation.The challengesToday, organisations existing in a fast-changing VUCA (Volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) world face immense challenges which existing data systems cannot perhaps comprehend or handle. Sure, an organisation can just develop new applications using a cloud model, but using the cloud in such a way is not transformational. And, it won’t result in significant cost savings or fast development. For a true transformation, both existing and new applications must be moved to a cloud-computing model.Secondly, there is way higher threat to data security today than there was a few years ago. To defend against sophisticated attacks, organisations need sophisticated partners, and adopt technologies that deliver optimum level of security.Thirdly, organisations cannot afford downtime for critical applications, which can cause financial damage. They need a cloud architecture that can handle all kinds of software and hardware failures, without the downtime.The solutionOracle Autonomous Database is far more sophisticated compared to manually-managed databases. It costs less to run and performs better by eliminating human error, reducing risks, and allowing more time for innovation.It is self-driving, which means that the user has to identify the service level to achieve, and the autonomous database will manage the rest. It is designed to be completely sealed from human access immediately after initial provisioning, exposing no management controls to the outside world. It does not need human assistance in provisioning, securing, monitoring, recovering, and troubleshooting. It reduces maintenance tasks by a significant volume, it is cheaper, and it will free up human resources for more meaningful tasks.In provisioning for instance, some human intervention is needed. But with autonomous, the user only needs to select the intended workload type and define the amounts of computer and storage resources needed along with the geographical location of the new instance. The rest is all automated.Oracle Autonomous Database is also self-repairing, which means that it protects itself against both external and internal attacks. It is capable of automatically applying security patches every quarter, which is sooner than manually operated databases. In effect, there is no downtime because autonomous applies patches on a rolling basis, securing itself.Oracle Autonomous Database can enable IT leaders to modernize enterprise computing, and insulate organisations from threats, and truly be transformational. It can help migrate the entire estate to the public cloud, while also saving cost and improving agility, immediately. It can help organisations run mission-critical workloads with a secure performant. Furthermore, it can cut administration costs by about 80%, and runtime costs by almost 90% as it automates administration and bills only for the resources needed at a particular time.With autonomous, Oracle has created an extremely advanced technology for the most demanding customers and situations, combining its decade-long experience in developing database solutions, the latest AI-powered innovations in the Oracle Database 18c and the scalability and performance of the dedicated Exadata hardware platform.

How about a morning run on the famous Jumeirah Beach followed by a coffee at a world-renowned café, all in the comfort of your holiday home? An all-new residential development coming up in the Emirate’s luxury Jumeirah beachfront, Madinat Jumeirah Living, promises an exclusive living experience in the luxury district. The sprawling 3.85 million square foot development is designed to highlight Arabian heritage, giving it a distinctive feel and character. On offer are luxury homes with a contemporary feel, all of which will have a clear view of the Burj Al Arab. The tastefully designed one, two, three and four-bedroom homes will be built in residential clusters surrounded by wadis, oases, and wind towers for an eclectic living experience. All these clusters will be inter-connected through shaded pedestrian walkways and jogging paths for seamless movement within the complex. To create a green living environment, cars will be kept out of bay and all vehicular movement will happen underground. The basement levels will house parking spaces for residents and visitors and car access at the ground level will be limited to only designated drop-off areas to keep fumes and emissions in control and give a cleaner and healthier life. Resident safety will be of utmost importance and people, especially small children and the elderly, will be able to move about freely at the ground level without the nuisance of cars. A central pedestrian walkway will run through the complex providing access to private community spaces where residents can come together and relax. Communal roof terraces and BBQ areas offer splendid views of Burj Al Arab and the Arabian Sea. Other facilities will include a gated home living environment, a suite of concierge services, play areas and parks for children, day cares for working mums, fitness centers and swimming pools for the health conscious, kilometers of cycling tracks running along the complex, a community center and community retail spaces. The location couldn’t get any better. Madinat Jumeirah Living is coming up right opposite Burj Al Arab, meeting between Jumeirah Beach and Umm Suqeim Roads. It is about a 25 minute drive from the Dubai International Airport. The complex is located near about two kilometers of private beachfront and will be right next to the luxurious five-star resort by the same name, called Madinat Jumeirah Resort, which has been developed over 40 hectares of landscapes and gardens. The complex will have a similar look and feel as the popular resort which houses three grand hotels, 29 traditional summer houses and 7 luxury villas. “Madinat Jumeirah Living is a natural extension to the hugely successful entertainment, hospitality, retail, tourism and lifestyle proposition of the Madinat Jumeirah resort, which we have built and enhanced over the years,” said His Excellency Abdulla Ahmed Al Habbai, Chairman of Dubai Holding, at the launch of the project.“Dubai holding is now elevating the masterplan of the prime Jumeirah district, taking it further to both address the demand of luxury living and to fully realize its potential as a truly holistic and world-class destination,” he added.Those living in the complex will have quick access to the resort through a new air-conditioned pedestrian bridge which is being constructed to connect the two. The resort has its own private beach and features over 50 restaurants and bars and a 1000-seat amphitheater and three kilometers of waterways and landscaped gardens. The Madinat Jumeirah Resort continues to be one of Dubai’s popular tourist haunts with a footfall of over 2.8 million visitors in the first half of 2018 alone. It has been host to prestigious events including the Dubai International Film festival, the World Government Summit and Art Dubai. Also in the neighborhood is the famous Wild Wadi water park which boasts of having the largest water slide outside of North America. The Madinat Jumeirah Waterways also house a turtle sanctuary which takes in injured turtles to look after them before releasing them back into the wild. The turtle pen is located at Mina a’Salaam. Being developed by Dubai Holding, which has constructed landmarks like Al Qasr, Mina Al Salam and Dar Al Masyaf, the complex is the first freehold residential development in the area. Construction of the Madinat Jumeirah Living complex will begin in 2019 and the first phase will be delivered within 30 months.Where we are:•2 minute drive to Sheikh Zayed Road•5 minute drive to Dubai Media City•8 minute drive to Dubai Internet City•5 minute drive to the nearest shopping mall•25 minute drive to Dubai International Airport", "Published_Date": "2018-10-31T13:06:49+05:30"},

Plan your taxes first! | Mint", "Author": "Promotional Feature, HT Brand Studio", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/promotional-feature, https://www.livemint.com/authors/ht-brand-studio", "Content": "So, you have just binge-watched two seasons of your favorite show, and are wondering which one to devour next.Because, what else can beat that feeling of tucking into your bed and finishing a series in 24 hours?But, wait, aren’t you forgetting something—something to do with your money?It’s your taxes!Chances are that you are groaning by now; perhaps even reeling under a panic attack. Isn’t that what most of us go through when we hear that word?Fret not! Like most things, tax planning is perfectly manageable if you plan ahead for it. Here’s how.Keep an eye on AprilIf you think that you can plan your taxes at the eleventh hour, and still manage to save a lot of money, you are mistaken. You will inevitably take a slew of bad decisions, and end up tearing your hair out. Therefore, start planning from April, which is the beginning of the financial year. But why is this so? It’s because most tax-saving products have a lock-in period. The earlier you invest, the earlier your lock-in period is completed. Start early to get higher returnsThere’s another benefit of starting early—the benefit of higher returns. For example, consider that you invest Rs. 1.5 lakh in Public Provident Fund (PPF) every year for 15 years. If you do it at the beginning of the year, your total returns would be Rs. 42.48 lakh. However, if you do it at the end of the year, the amount would stand at Rs. 39.48 lakh. That’s a difference of a whopping Rs. 3 lakh! Reason enough to not procrastinate anymore? Take stock of your investmentsOnce you have calculated your taxable income, your next step is to find ways to reduce it. Section 80C of the Income Tax Act comes with a range of options to help salaried individuals lower their tax liabilities for as high as Rs. 1,50,000. Investments in PPF, life insurance, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and Unit-Linked Insurance Products (ULIPs) can help you get a deduction under this section. Contributions towards pension plans and the New Pension Scheme (NPS) also qualify for tax benefits under different sub-sections of Section 80C.Pursue tax-saving avenues other than Section 80CHave you availed of an education loan? You can claim tax exemptions on the interest you pay towards it under Section 80E. Do you have a health insurance/mediclaim policy? Use the premiums that you pay towards it to lower your tax liability under Section 80D. Did you recently opt for a home loan? Then you are eligible for tax benefits under Section 80EE. Don’t have a house, but stay on rent? You can use your rent receipts to claim tax benefits under Section 80GG. Did you recently write a book (other than textbooks for schools and colleges), and receive payment in royalty? Then you can claim that amount as deduction under Section 80QQB. So you see, there is never a shortage of avenues when it comes to saving your hard-earned money. Get a tax advisor if you aren’t too sureAre you one of those who have finished reading up till this point, but still find tax planning a tad too complicated? Why, you can always opt for a tax advisor! He will not only help you to minimize your taxes in the current year, but also reduce them in the future. Most importantly, since taxes cover a lot of areas in personal finance, he’ll have plenty of recommendations for you about your overall financial health. If you have just started earning and are looking for a sound tax-saving plan, it’s all the more reason for you to visit an advisor. Last, but not the least, file your taxes well before the last date. This will ensure that you don’t make any errors. What’s more, filing your taxes on time will spare you a hefty fine levied by the IT Department. You also get faster refunds when you file your taxes early. ", "Published_Date": "2018-12-03T11:10:28+05:30"},

In fact, you’d be surprised how most mid-segment phones today— especially from OEMs such as OPPO — can up the style quotient with the right contours, the finish, and the shine. Not only do they look good, but they also feel great to hold. Not the flimsy plastic of yesteryear, and the lackluster screens with massive bezels. Today, you can expect much more. We recently had an opportunity to review one such looker – the OPPO A7. Read below to see what we discovered when we spent a few days with it. OPPO is back with ‘the drop’, i.e. the iconic water drop design that they pioneered with the F9 Pro. The OPPO A7 comes with a 4GB RAM memory and internal storage of 64 GB, which is expandable up to 256 GB using a micro SD card. The phone’s front camera is at a 16-megapixel image resolution, while the dual-camera rear setup is at 13 and 2 mega-pixels. This decision to have a better resolution on the front-facing camera may appear odd at first, but it makes sense for a brand that has been known for producing great ‘selfie’ camera phones.Design &amp; OSA waterdrop screen on the front gives the user more screen real estate, namely all 6.2 inches of it. The result is a 19:9 aspect ratio, which will hopefully convince people to view videos in landscape mode (yes, there are too many ‘portrait mode’ viewers and it feels like quite a waste). The screen’s resolution of 1520 x 720 pixels is standard fare in this seg-ment, but the screen’s colours really pop, making video-viewing and gaming an engaging experience (and some pretty powerful speakers enhance those experiences!).Makes perfect sense, therefore, for such colours to be complemented by a ColorOS 5.2 operating system, running on Android v8.1. The OS is quite easy on the eyes with its soft rounded menu corners, with white backgrounds that improve readability. What we espe-cially loved was the way the long-press and context menus slide in from the right or left edge of the screen. The phone comes pre-loaded with the Google stock apps, and has a few other useful apps like a Compass, a One-Tap Lockscreen option, an FM Radio and a Clone Phone feature. The latter makes shifting from an old device a breeze.The screen itself is encased in one of the more beautiful smartphone form factors you’ll see in the market. The waterdrop design on the front carries forward the tradition set by the F9 Pro but flip the phone around, and you’ll be greeted by another innovation from OPPO’s design labs: a metallic surface with a beautiful, soft reflection gradient. This par-ticular model is the Glaring Gold variant, but there is also a Glaze Blue model. Upon closer inspection, one notices diagonal grooves etched into the phone, which prevent the phone from slipping out of your hands. A phone that feels like it should belong in a castle is actually in your hands for quite a competitive price, so OPPO has really hit this one out of the park.CameraThe phone’s camera has been spoken about briefly earlier, so here are a few photos with both the front and rear camera setups. As you can see, the colours look quite authentic, the images aren’t washed out and the resolution is quite sharp. However, selfies are what OPPO is known for, and thanks to the 16 MP camera, we get some really great selfies as well. There is also quite a collection of AR stickers available for the selfie enthusiasts out there, and what’s most impressive is how well they track your face in real time.PerformanceAll these features, however, need a solid powerhouse to run it. The OPPO A7’s power-house is an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor and a whopping 4230 mAh of battery power. For the entire duration that we’ve had the phone, up until the time this review was written, we’ve had to charge the battery a grand total of ONCE. That’s a 2-day battery back-up. Such a long-lasting battery can be of great reassurance to a potential buyer and might even be what seals the deal.This new smartphone falls into the mid-range segment with a price of  ₹ 16,990. Overall, the OPPO A7 may come with the standard hardware for its price point, but its outer beauty from back to front, its speedy and innovatively designed OS, and most importantly, its massive battery back-up, should make a lot of people reconsider purchasing a different phone within this price range.", "Published_Date": "2018-11-30T16:01:08+05:30"},

Here&#8217;s where to go! | Mint", "Author": "Promotional Feature, HT Brand Studio", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/promotional-feature, https://www.livemint.com/authors/ht-brand-studio", "Content": "If you have trouble sticking to New Year resolutions, here’s an easy one for you. In the coming year, keep a bag with spare clothes handy, a favorite travel-mate nearby, and make a pact with the road. Over long and short weekends, travel to far-off places, let your wheels roll over unexplored terrain, and belong to the road. Don’t be a dusty and sweaty backpacker, if that’s not your thing. With the company of state-of-the-art high-end SUVs, such as the new Alturas G4, you can be an adventurer who travels with elegance and style. Whether you’re a seasoned traveler or just planning your first big road trip, here’s a list of destinations spanning the length and breadth of India, with notes and recommendations specially curated for a luxury traveler.1.Delhi to LehAs one of the most popular road trips in India, the mecca for travelers, a trip to Leh may have either been on your ‘to-do’ list or ‘done-that’ list. Either way, the best way to travel to Leh from Delhi (if you don’t want to break your back on a motorbike) is with a rugged and sturdy SUV. This trip provides you plenty of road-time, as the journey stretches a solid 1,000 km at least. There are two ways to do this road trip: Delhi-Manali-Leh, or take the road less traveled from Delhi-Srinagar-Kargil-Leh. If you are a frequent road traveler, you can make multiple stops along the way and explore places around Leh, such as Tso Moriri, Pangong, and Sarchu. Be sure to pick an SUV with a smooth cruise control, which will have you gliding across the panoramic landscapes of Leh in style. 2.Bangalore to Ooty/CoorgIf you’re not looking for a 10-day road trip as the one above, but instead are interested in a weekend getaway in the south, drive down from Bangalore to Ooty and be welcomed by the chilly weather at the hill station. Around 340 km south, the trip will take you about 7-8 hours and through places such as the historical Mysore, the green fields of Gundlupet, and the jungle safaris at Bandipur and Mudummalai. While the altitudes to climb won’t be too high, it’s probably best to check for a vehicle that has advanced features like Hill Descent Control (HDC) and Hill Start Assist (HSA). Another destination could be the gorgeous Coorg, where you could stay amidst the most aromatic coffee plantations in the country. Let your SUV sweep you away from the noise and into the quiet of the lush green hills, valleys, and canopied highways of the south. 3.Kolkata to Lake Tsomgo For travelers who wish to venture into the north east, here’s the perfect trip for you. Although the road from Kolkata to Lake Tsomgo (in East Sikkim) is long (about 730 km), the drive will be worth it! If you don’t mind the cold, travel to Lake Tsomgo in the winter, and catch the mesmerizing beauty of the frozen lake. Note to drivers: venturing into the corners of the east, you’ll realize the need to have a dependable and powerful engine drive you around the narrow and winding roads. There are lots of local taxis that drive you around the north East, but to experience the driving yourself, ensure that your vehicle supports top of the line braking and robust safety systems, so that you can sit back and watch the miles roll by. 4.Jaipur to JaisalmerIf sandy deserts and old palaces are more your thing, don’t wait to take a trip towards the north western India. A comfortable 600 km ride, this road trip will take you through the old towns of Rajasthan and also the sprawling deserts of the west. If you wish, stretch your trip into four or five days, so you can add a few stops on the way. Rajasthan’s majestic beauty of the sand dunes, mighty palaces, and rich culture needs to felt in a drive-through, making your experience with the state more intimate. Although the roads are considerably well-maintained, the rough terrain might need to be matched with a rough machine. 5. Mumbai to TarkarliIf you don’t have time to travel to the four corners of the country, here’s another quiet road trip destination for you: drive down from the noisy city life into the quiet and pristine beaches of Tarkarli in Maharashtra. A good 600 km, this road trip will take you through the food towns of Maharashtra, including Kolhapur. Make a couple of swift stops through these towns to reach the clean and beautiful Tarkarli. With these destinations in mind, take a trip once every few weeks, and you’ll see the difference travel-rejuvenation makes. Although traveling is fun, do not underestimate the amount of planning, coordination, and attention to safety that comes, especially with road trips. Hence, to make your journeys smooth, comfortable, and luxurious, pick an SUV that affords you the joy of all the wanderlusting without any of the stressing.  The new Alturas G4 is designed exactly for this purpose. A high-end, full-sized SUV, the Alturas G4 will ensure safety, stability, comfort, and style for each of these trips. The vehicle’s powerful engine can handle any kind of road demand, and its advanced safety and comfort features will make sure you return home refreshed, relaxed, and rested. Travel with the Alturas G4, and make the New Year a year full of adventures. To book a test drive, please click here.", "Published_Date": "2018-12-28T15:58:15+05:30"},

A sedentary lifestyle has incredibly negative effects on the body, and can lead to long-term health related complications. “Sitting is more dangerous than smoking, kills more people than HIV and is more treacherous than parachuting. We are sitting ourselves to death,” says James Levine, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, in an interview in with the LA Times. “The chair is out to kill us.”Cause for concernNearly 61% of all deaths in India are due to lifestyle issues. The World Health Organization identifies, among other things, lack of physical activity to be a major cause of such diseases. Unfortunately, most jobs entail sitting down for an average of 9.3 hours a day. This is almost inevitable, but exceptionally large amounts of time outside work are also spent in sedentary positions—often in front of a television or computer screen. The modern lifestyle is notoriously lacking when it comes to emphasizing the importance of physical fitness.Research by the University of Liverpool reveals that two weeks of inactivity in young, healthy people can reduce muscle mass and produce metabolic changes leading to an increased risk of developing chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and potentially premature death. Now, imagine what a lifetime of nine-hour desk jobs will do.More than a 100 million individuals are obese in India, according to a community-based study done in November 2016 on prevalence of obesity among urban population of Shivamogga, Karnataka.The National Family Health Survey (NFHS); 2015-16 revealed that 11% of women (1 in 10) and 15% of men (1 in 7) in the age group of 15-49 are hypertensive.Time to rethink your lifestyle, maybe?Get movingTo begin with the obvious, start with building an exercise habit. Data reveals that 60 to 75 minutes of moderately intense physical activity can counter the effects of excessive sitting (1). It is also important to supplement exercise with some daily positive physical habits. A few useful ones are mentioned below:-Take a break from sitting every thirty minutes. Stand up at your desk and stretch your legs.-Consider asking for a standing desk.-Have walking meetings with your colleagues.-If you have to ask something, walk to your colleagues’ desks instead of emailing them or using the office chat.-Use the stairs instead of the elevator.-Park farther from the office entrance and walk.-If you use public transportation, get off one stop earlier and walk.Of course, you also need to be prepared for the worst, which means having a health insurance plan in place. Not only will this allow you to deal with unforeseen medical expenses, but provide you with a peace of mind. After all, you don’t need stress to make things worse for body and mind. Consider opting for the Click 2 Protect Health plan from HDFC Life, which provides you and your family financial protection at an affordable cost. In case of accidental total permanent disability or diagnosis of a critical illness, all your future premiums will be waived off. The policy will also fetch you tax benefits.Link:1. https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/sitting/faq-20058005", "Published_Date": "2019-01-08T18:46:04+05:30"},

Notably, stocks within the capital goods sector have garnered significant attention from investors. This sector, encompassing industries that manufacture machinery and equipment used for industrial production, construction, and infrastructure, has shown remarkable performance.The government's increasing focus on infrastructure development has played a pivotal role in this trend. Massive investments in building roads, highways, bridges, and ports have created a robust demand for capital goods, driving up stock prices in this sector.&nbsp;Also Read: Quant Mutual Fund: How many days will it take to to liquidate its portfolio?Additionally, the push for affordable housing has led to increased construction activities, further boosting the demand for construction equipment and machinery. Rural electrification initiatives have also contributed to the sector's growth. The complete electrification of the railway network by 2025 is another key factor driving investor confidence in the capital goods space.&nbsp;One of the standout performers in the capital goods space in recent years was Kirloskar Oil Engines (KOEL), a leading manufacturer of diesel engines and diesel generator sets. In the current year so far, the stock has climbed from around  ₹662 apiece to the current position of  ₹1,402, producing a staggering return of 114%.Over the last 2 years, the shares have gained 978% while they jumped 1210% over the last four years.Also Read: TBO Tek stock jumps 11% to hit new all-time high after Goldman Sachs initiates coverage with 'buy' ratingKirloskar Oil Engines has been dominating the power generator market for the last three decades.

This IT stock has catapulted from approximately  ₹136 to  ₹295 per share, delivering a staggering 115 percent return to its positional shareholders. This dramatic increase in MosChip Technologies share price can be attributed to the company's receipt of a subsidy under the semiconductor design linked incentive (DLI) scheme from the government of India, as well as the acquisition of substantial work orders. Market experts predict that the stock's bullish trend will continue, potentially reaching  ₹330 and  ₹350 if it remains above  ₹270 for the next few sessions.Why MosChip Technologies share price is surging?Reiterating the positive factors that have fueled MosChip Technologies' share price, Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities, said, \"The IT stock has been appreciating after receiving the approval from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India (GoI) for a subsidy under the DLI Scheme.

However, it is crucial to maintain a stop loss at  ₹270 when initiating any new position.

Cities have sued to recoup those costs, typically seeking damages in the tens of millions of dollars.The companies said the agreement would resolve all PFAS-related water-system claims against them. They said the settlement could eventually cover public systems that provide drinking water to the majority of the U.S. population.The current settlement wouldn’t resolve water-system lawsuits against other companies, including 3M, which is set to go to trial in federal court Monday in a case brought by a Florida city.Chemours said it would contribute half of the settlement funds, or about $592 million, while DuPont would contribute about $400 million, and Corteva would contribute about $193 million. The companies said the money would be deposited into a water-district settlement fund within 10 days following preliminary approval of the settlement by the court.The settlement would exclude water systems operated by the U.S. government, as well as small systems that haven’t detected PFAS and aren’t required to test for it, the companies said. If too many systems opt out of the settlement, the companies said they have the right to terminate it.“If a settlement cannot be finalized and approved and plaintiffs elect to pursue their claims in court, the companies will continue to assert their strong legal defenses in pending litigation,” the companies said.Plaintiffs attorneys said the settlement wouldn’t resolve other lawsuits filed against the three companies such as personal-injury claims brought by firefighters, military personnel and others who say exposure to the foam caused cancer and other illnesses. Other foam-related lawsuits pending involve claims for cleaning up soil and groundwater.Paul Napoli, a lead plaintiffs attorney in the firefighting-foam litigation, said the proposed settlement was a “significant stride toward justice.” But citing the remaining claims, he said the plaintiffs would “relentlessly continue to demand DuPont and others fully answer for their actions.”“The wake of their actions has left an indelible mark on countless Americans, causing personal injuries and cancer, including among our bravest—firefighters and military personnel who have developed cancer due to exposure to these chemicals,” Napoli said. “This settlement barely scratches the surface of the vast harm inflicted.”Chemours, DuPont and Corteva have previously said that they believe the firefighting-foam complaints are without merit, and that they look forward “to vigorously defending our record of safety, health and environmental stewardship.”The proposed settlement is subject to the approval of Judge Richard Gergel in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. He is overseeing more than 4,000 lawsuits involving PFAS in firefighting foam that have been consolidated.In 2021, DuPont entered into an agreement to share future PFAS liability costs with Chemours and Corteva, two companies spun off from DuPont’s predecessor businesses during the past decade. The agreement is set to last until 2040 and is capped at $4 billion.The total PFAS liability for DuPont, Chemours and Corteva, which would include other lawsuits that don’t involve firefighting foam, such as personal-injury claims tied to industrial discharges of the chemicals, has been estimated at $19.5 billion by Capstone, a Washington-based firm that advises investors and companies on regulatory issues.Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015, now operates DuPont’s legacy chemicals business.Chemours said in legal filings that the company never manufactured or sold firefighting foam containing PFAS. Before the spinoff, the former DuPont had made chemicals which were then used by other companies that made and sold the foam.PFAS, once used in everything from pizza boxes to semiconductors, have increasingly been the focus of regulations and efforts by companies to remove them amid mounting evidence linking them to cancers and other health problems. In March, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first federal limits on six types of PFAS in drinking water, which the agency said could require water systems serving up to 94 million people to install costly treatment systems.The number of lawsuits involving PFAS has exploded amid growing regulations. Cases involving firefighting foam that contained the chemicals have grown from about 75 in 2018 to more than 4,000 today. PFAS are called forever chemicals because they don’t break down in the environment.The settlement announced Friday comes on the eve of the first bellwether trial in that litigation, set to begin Monday in Judge Gergel’s courtroom in Charleston, S.C. The trial will pit Stuart, Fla., a city of 18,000 north of Palm Beach, against 3M, once a leading manufacturer of firefighting foam containing PFAS.Stuart has sued 3M for $115 million to recover the cost of installing and operating a filtration system over the next 40 years to remove PFAS from the city’s drinking water and to clean up contaminated soil.3M and the other companies have said in legal filings that the chemicals haven’t been shown to cause health problems at the levels being discovered in drinking water. It has argued in court filings that the city is seeking “wildly inflated damages.”3M has said that “PFAS are safely made and used in many modern products” but that it would no longer manufacture the chemicals by the end of 2025 because of increased regulations focused on reducing their presence in the environment.The firefighting foam, known as aqueous film-forming foam, or AFFF, had been widely used since the 1960s by the military and fire departments, often during training exercises in which the foam was allowed to seep into the groundwater.", "Published_Date": "2023-06-02T18:21:14+05:30"},

In its recent update on consumer sector, it highlighted sluggish demand in the quick service restaurants (QSRs) sector due to downtrading and intense competition from regional players and smaller chains.\"Burgers performed strongly through the first half of FY24, although this trend began with the pizza category which was under extreme pressure. Westlife Food World and Burger King saw good same-store sales growth through 1HFY24, but Jubilant Food Works and Pizza Hut saw negative growth. But beginning in the second half of FY24, burger companies began to suffer pressure from a slowing demand, geopolitical issues, and potential competition (from newcomers and other cuisines),\" it pointed out.PL believes this is just the beginning. With increasing competition from local chains, the pressure in the burger category is likely to persist. Consequently, the possibility of burgers following the trend seen in pizza chains seems increasingly likely, it said.As per the brokerage, the number of pizza outlets among the top three brands doubled from 1,654 to 3,331, while major burger chains increased by only 50 percent from 789 to 1,197 during FY20-24. This growth trajectory has impacted industry growth rates and profitability. PL forecasts a 38 percent rise in the number of burger outlets among the top players from FY24 to FY26, compared to an 18 percent increase in pizza outlets.While burger chains are yet to fully experience the competitive pressures, pizza chains may be approaching the bottom of their economic downturn, noted the brokerage. It anticipates that pizza players will recover with mid-single-digit same-store sales growth (SSSG), faster than burger companies.Among stocks, PL recommends a Hold call on Jubilant FoodWorks with a target price of  ₹490 (13 percent downside) and Accumulate on Westlife Foodworld with a target price of  ₹817 (3 percent downside).Sector update - pizzas and burgersThe Quick Service Restaurant sector in India has traditionally been dominated by multinational giants like McDonald’s, Domino’s, Burger King, and Pizza Hut, which have established strong brand loyalty over the years. Despite their success, these brands only penetrate around 425 cities in India, leaving ample room for growth in a country with a large and aspirational youth population, noted PL.It further highlighted that local competition is intensifying within the QSR space, as many homegrown brands ambitiously expand nationally, offering burgers and pizzas with unique flavors at competitive prices. These brands benefit from lower costs associated with localised product development, establishing regional supply chains, and managing overhead expenses effectively.Over the past few years, the number of pizza outlets among the top three players has surged from 1,437 to 2,932 stores between FY17 and FY23 (excluding other players like Oven Story, Sbarro, Pizzeria, MojoPizza, Smokin’ Joe’s, etc.). Despite this growth, major pizza chains have faced challenges such as declining same-store sales growth and profitability. These setbacks are attributed not just to a slowdown in consumer demand but also to rapid store expansions and heightened competition within the sector, it stated.In contrast, burgers have been part of India's culinary landscape for over two decades, available even in smaller towns. Recently, however, the market has witnessed the rise of both regional and national burger chains like Burger Singh, Burgrill, Hello Burger’s, alongside many cafes incorporating burgers into their menus, the brokerage pointed out.Looking ahead, the number of outlets operated by major players such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s (for home delivery), and Burger Singh, is expected to grow significantly, expanding from 789 outlets in FY20 to an anticipated 1,675 by FY26.Are burger chains following the pizza industry?PL noted that the pizza category has been grappling with significant demand pressures and a slowdown in recent quarters, while the burger category maintained its resilience and outpaced pizza until the latter half of FY24.Factors contributing to the pizza category's challenges include intense competition from smaller and regional players like Pizzeria, MojoPizza, and La Pinoz Pizza, offering competitive pricing. Moreover, leading players struggled to capitalise on the premiumisation trend observed in gourmet pizza brands. The rapid expansion of store counts by major chains over the past five years further intensified competition. Consumer behavior also shifted towards lower-priced segments below  ₹100, driven by competitive strategies from major players seeking greater market share, it observed.Meanwhile, the burger category sustained resilience until the second quarter of FY24, after which it faced softened demand due to heightened competition, geopolitical influences, and overall economic slowdown. Domestic chains like Burger Singh, Burgrill, and Hello Burger have emerged prominently, particularly in the northern region, with plans for further expansion into southern and western markets, it further added.Moreover, the pizza segment saw higher discounts and special offers. The launch of “Flavour Fun” range by Pizza Hut has disturbed the balance at the bottom end of the market. The profits of both Jubilant FoodWorks and Pizza Hut took a big hit in FY24. Similarly, burger chains like Westlife Foodworld reported lower EBITDA margins in FY24 due to deteriorating SSSG. Burger King has not been impacted so far as it has a low base and has shown positive SSSG so far.\"The QSR industry is experiencing unprecedented competition from regional players, which initially began in the pizza category. Pizza companies suffered a significant decline in SSSG for four consecutive quarters. Subsequently, increasing competitive intensity began to affect the SSSG of burger companies, although not to the extent seen in the pizza category,\" it noted.&nbsp;Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

This positive trend is in line with the company's recent financial performance, which saw the small-cap agri stock logging an intraday high of over 6 percent during Tuesday deals.Mangalam Global Enterprises newsIn a press statement shared by the company, it was announced that Mangalam Global Enterprise Ltd has entered into an agreement on June 18, 2024, to purchase plant, machinery and buildings from Shree Gurukrupa Oil and Foods and lands admeasuring 19,833 square yards at Jotana, Mehasana, Gujarat.

He believes the current financial year (FY25) may be a year of earnings normalisation, and small and mid-caps, trading at near all-time high valuations, will likely benefit from a bottom-up approach. In an interview with Mint, Bhasin shares his thoughts about the current market valuation and what the market expects from the upcoming Union Budget 2024.Edited excerpts:We have a coalition government at the Centre. Do you expect the pace of growth, which was earlier anticipated, to slow down? Can there be a major policy shift from capital expenditure to revenue expenditure?The power dynamics under a coalition government undoubtedly change, but it would be unreasonable to believe that genuine economic reforms will take a back seat.&nbsp;In fact, coalition governments in India have been credited with implementing bold reforms.&nbsp;Measures that might centralise power, like One Nation, One Election, could take a back seat, but economic reforms will likely proceed as planned.&nbsp;The government must address the economic demand issues, especially at the middle and bottom of the pyramid.&nbsp;However, this does not necessarily mean that the government will have to reduce capital expenditure to accommodate higher revenue expenditure.&nbsp;Such adjustments can be made within the existing framework utilising additional revenues, such as RBI dividends, without upsetting fiscal calculations.What are the market's expectations from Budget 2024? What are the key areas that the government should focus on?The markets generally anticipate measures from the government to alleviate distress at the bottom of the pyramid through increased expenditure.&nbsp;We expect such measures in the upcoming budget, possibly including higher allocations for schemes like PM-KISAN and MGNREGA.&nbsp;The government could also consider reducing income tax rates for low and middle-income earners to boost demand.&nbsp;However, we do not foresee an increase in the fiscal deficit or a reduction in capital expenditure to fund additional revenue expenditure.&nbsp;These measures should align with the existing fiscal deficit target of 5.1 per cent of GDP for FY25, down from 5.6 per cent in FY24.It is now evident that the Fed will only cut rates once this year, and any rate cuts are likely to be modest. Do you think the era of ultra-low interest rates from before the pandemic is over? How should retail investors invest in a higher interest rate environment?The growth-inflation dynamics in the US suggest that more than one rate cut in CY24 is unlikely.&nbsp;Overcoming the last phase of disinflation has proven to be challenging. Therefore, investors should prepare for 'higher-for-longer' interest rates.&nbsp;Investing in quality names, preferably large caps, would be a prudent strategy.What are your thoughts on the current valuation of the Indian market? Is it sustainable?All equity segments—large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps—are trading at the higher end of their TTM (trailing 12-month) P/B (price-to-book) ranges, indicating subdued returns in the coming year.&nbsp;While large caps appear relatively less expensive, there is a significant divergence in valuations between BFSI and non-BFSI sectors.&nbsp;Currently, the Nifty Ex-BFSI universe trades at an all-time high premium of 44 per cent over BFSI on a 12-month forward P/E (price-to-earnings) basis, compared to a five-year average of nearly 6 per cent.&nbsp;We expect this gap to normalize this year.&nbsp;With earnings growth slowing down, valuations for mid and small-caps should also stabilise.&nbsp;We do not anticipate market multiples sustaining, as FY25 is expected to normalize earnings trajectory estimates.&nbsp;Negative earnings surprises have increased over the last two quarters, with aggregate NSE 500 earnings surprises at -3 per cent.&nbsp;This trend is likely to continue, leading to a potential de-rating of market multiples over the next 12 months.Which sectors are expected to see healthy gains in the next one to two years?Banks: The banking sector is robust, with high capital levels, significant coverage of NPAs, stable asset quality, and consistent loan growth of 15-16 per cent year-on-year (YoY).&nbsp;Despite contributing around 50 per cent of Nifty FY24 EPS growth, banks have underperformed the market by approximately 8 per cent over the past 12 months.&nbsp;We expect this underperformance to reverse, with banks outperforming the Nifty by about 20 per cent over the next 12 months.Telecom: Despite recent re-rating, the telecom industry remains promising due to favourable regulatory conditions and enterprise and home entertainment services opportunities.&nbsp;The consensus earnings trajectory for telecom firms also points to positive growth in FY25 and FY26.India is expected to experience an above-normal monsoon this year. How will this impact market sentiment?An above-normal monsoon is positive news for India. Agricultural growth declined to 1.4 per cent in FY24, down from 4.7 per cent in FY23, adversely affecting rural consumption.&nbsp;A normal monsoon should boost agricultural GVA growth, aided by a low base effect, which will, in turn, stimulate demand.&nbsp;Increased spending on welfare schemes, widely expected in this scenario, will further alleviate stress in rural areas.&nbsp;FMCG and auto companies with high rural exposure are likely to benefit the most from improved sentiment.Would you recommend investing in the IT sector at this juncture? What is the outlook for them?We maintain a fundamental ‘sell’ call in the IT sector. Growth, margins, and cash generation have deteriorated across the sector.FY24 saw the highest consensus EPS (earning per share) estimate cuts for Nifty IT since 2009, despite only a mild correction in the Nifty IT index in CY24.Market expectations for strong earnings growth reversion in FY25 seem optimistic, and we anticipate further earnings downgrades.Despite valuation concerns, mid and small-caps have shown resilience. What should be the investment strategy for these segments?As mentioned earlier, FY25 is expected to be a year of earnings normalisation.Small and mid-caps, trading at near all-time high valuations, will likely benefit from a bottom-up approach.An earnings momentum strategy focused on stocks with sequential TTM EPS expansion (TTM EPS quarter-on-quarter per cent) can potentially generate alpha in the current environment.This strategy has historically outperformed the index, particularly in small and mid-cap segments.Read all market-related news hereDisclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of the expert, not Mint.

During the opening bell, the small-cap stock was one of the newsmakers as the company had informed Indian exchanges about the breakthrough in overseas business.The small-cap pharma company is successfully developing new sales channels through direct sales to hospitals in Angola. It has made a notable entry into the tender business for pharmaceutical formulations in the Latin American markets.Breakthrough in the Angola marketIn a strategic move to strengthen its footprint in the African continent, Balaxi Pharmaceuticals has strategically tied up with approximately 50 hospitals across Angola and is working towards having tie-ups with more than 150 hospitals across the country. This expansion into the hospital business not only marks a significant milestone for the company but also demonstrates our long-term vision and commitment to the African market. It allows us to directly supply high-quality pharmaceutical products to healthcare providers in the region, enhancing the availability of essential medicines in Angola and positioning Balaxi as a key player in the country's healthcare sector.Entry into Latin America businessBalaxi Pharmaceuticals has also made a significant entry into the tender business by securing a tender in a key Latin American market. This tender, valued at USD 0.8 million, marks the company's first foray into the large tender business in Latin America. This achievement underscores Balaxi's growing international presence and its capability to meet the stringent requirements of large-scale pharmaceutical supply contracts.Speaking on these overseas business updates, Ashish Maheshwari, the visionary Managing Director of Balaxi Pharmaceuticals Limited, shared his insights on this development: \"Expanding distribution through hospitals channel in Angola represents a pivotal step in our mission to improve access to affordable and quality healthcare in Angola. By directly engaging with hospitals, we ensure that our products reach the patients who need them the most, thereby contributing to better healthcare outcomes.\" This personal touch from our leader underscores our commitment to our mission and the importance we place on improving healthcare access.\"Securing our first tender in a key Latin America market is a testament to our commitment to expanding our global footprint. This success in the Latin American market diversifies our revenue streams and validates our strategic approach to entering new geographies with high growth potential. Also, once the new plant is up and running, tender market opportunities in other ROW and semi-regulated markets will be pursued aggressively,\" added Ashish Maheshwari.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts, and broking companies, not of Mint.

Epstein died in jail that year before he was tried. JPMorgan declined to comment beyond its earlier statements that it was a mistake to deal with Epstein and that the bank would have never associated with him if it knew about his alleged sex trafficking.JPMorgan has been fighting a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Virgin Islands alleging the bank ignored red flags about Epstein’s behavior because he was bringing in wealthy clients for the bank. The bank this month agreed to pay $290 million to settle a similar lawsuit brought by an unnamed woman on behalf of herself and other Epstein victims.The report, showing what the bank knew about its Epstein ties, is now part of the dispute with the U.S. Virgin Islands and could be made public in the legal proceedings.Epstein was a JPMorgan client before and after he was convicted in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution. He had a close relationship with Staley, who ran its private bank for wealthy clients and later its investment bank, and several other bank officials. Epstein and Staley exchanged hundreds of emails, according to the U.S. Virgin Islands lawsuit. Staley left JPMorgan in 2013 and went on to become CEO of Barclays.JPMorgan has sued Staley claiming he misled the bank. And it said Staley was the executive who was accused of sexual assault by the Epstein accuser who sued the bank.Lawyers for Staley, who left Barclays in 2021, have denied the allegations against him. He has said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. Staley’s daughter didn’t respond to a request for comment.The 2019 JPMorgan report said that Epstein had appeared to have forged close relationships with senior executives and government officials, including Dubai’s Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem and British politician Peter Mandelson. Epstein tried to connect these associates to Staley and the bank for business deals and international expansions.In December 2009, Epstein wrote emails to both bin Sulayem and Staley to set up a meeting between them and advised Staley on how to conduct himself with bin Sulayem and what to expect from him, according to the report. In one email, he told Staley, “sultan is laying the groundwork for you to establish a serious presence. jpm reputation in the region is poor.”Bin Sulayem, who is CEO of ports operator DP World, had several visits scheduled at Epstein’s townhouse between 2011 and 2014, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.Bin Sulayem and his representative didn’t respond to requests for comment.The JPMorgan report shows Epstein involved in email conversations in 2010 with Staley and Mandelson regarding JPMorgan’s efforts to purchase the Royal Bank of Scotland’s stake in Sempra Energy and a mining deal in the Congo.Mandelson, a member of the House of Lords and former member of cabinet in the U.K. who associated with Epstein, said in a statement to the Journal that he “very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein.” Mandelson said his connections to Epstein have been known and that he “never had any kind of professional or business relationship with Epstein in any form.”In May 2012, the report said, JPMorgan private bankers advised Epstein on how to structure a deal for an unnamed client to buy Edvard Munch’s pastel “The Scream.” That month, Leon Black, the billionaire private-equity founder who was a frequent visitor to Epstein’s home, according to documents reviewed by the Journal, bought the artwork for nearly $120 million.Black didn’t work with Epstein or JPMorgan on the purchase, a spokesman for Black said. Black has said he paid Epstein for tax and estate advice.The 2019 report said that Staley and the bank’s current head of asset and wealth management, Mary Erdoes, had “regular communication with Jeffrey Epstein related to certain strategic initiatives and business proposals” starting in 2011 and there are “occasional personal emails between Erdoes and Epstein interspersed.”Staley communicated with Epstein more than Erdoes did, the report shows, and Staley appeared to share nonpublic information with Epstein. Staley told Epstein about executive changes at JPMorgan ahead of their announcement and discussed deals JPMorgan was trying to execute. The two men discussed women, the report shows, and referred to themselves as “family.”“That was fun. Say hi to Snow White,” Staley wrote in a July 2010 email to Epstein, according to the report.Epstein responded: “[W]hat character would you like next?” and Staley replied, “Beauty and the Beast.”The report said Epstein offered to help one of Staley’s daughters in applying for graduate schools, including Columbia University. Epstein said he would get in touch with various Columbia officials and offered to connect Staley to the university’s president at the Davos World Economic Forum in 2011.“There was no meeting between the president and Staley. Nor did the president know Epstein, then or later,” a Columbia spokesman said. “There is no factual basis for these assertions.”In 2011, Staley wrote to Epstein, “You have paid a price for what has been accused,” according to an email in the report. “But we know what u have done for us. And we count you as one of our deepest friends. And most honest of people.”", "Published_Date": "2023-06-20T21:56:24+05:30"},

Traditionally, this halving has boosted prices, but with Bitcoin recently reaching a historic high, doubts have emerged about the likelihood of a similar outcome this time.Other key driving factor behind the decline is the cryptocurrency is influenced by stronger-than-anticipated US retail sales figures for March, which bolstered the belief that the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to hastily reduce interest rates this year.Also read: Bitcoin halving expected on April 20, here's what it means; should you invest?A few days ago, Hong Kong granted conditional approval for its first spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a significant step towards the city potentially becoming Asia's pioneer in embracing cryptocurrencies as a mainstream investment vehicle.

Based on current projections, the upcoming halving is expected to occur either late Friday or early Saturday.Also read: Bitcoin falls 8% in five days; here are 4 reasons behind the plungeWhat is bitcoin halving?The halving refers to an alteration in the foundational blockchain technology of Bitcoin, aimed at decreasing the pace of generating new bitcoins.Since its creation by the pseudonymous figure Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has been structured to possess a finite supply of 21 million tokens.This marks the fourth halving event in Bitcoin's history. The initial halving in 2012 saw the reward drop from $50 to $25. The most recent halving will further reduce the reward to $3.125, equivalent to nearly $200,000 at current prices, with Bitcoin trading at $64,000 as of April 19.The process of halving will persist until 2041, by which time all Bitcoins will have been mined. However, this particular Bitcoin halving event is anticipated to deviate from its predecessors due to recent geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, which have stirred market instability. Consequently, Bitcoin witnessed a significant downturn, plummeting to its lowest level in a month. On Friday, during the Asia session, Bitcoin experienced a decline exceeding 5.5%, falling to $59,961.“In the long term, this supply reduction could attract more institutional and retail capital while amplifying Bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio. ZebPay is bullish about both the short-term as well as long-term outlook for Bitcoin and the wider crypto market,” said Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay.Also read: Bitcoin halving expected on April 20, here's what it means; should you invest?How bitcoin halving will impact the crypto market?Experts say that the halving event might impact Bitcoin's price as its heightened scarcity could result in upward pressure on prices and attract a wave of new investors to the cryptocurrency market.Typically, Bitcoin experiences a significant rally approximately 60 days before the halving event. This has been observed consistently in the past cycles, including 2016 and 2020, where the cryptocurrency often reaches new all-time highs, according to expertsFollowing the rally, there is often a retrace period that tends to occur around 28 to 14 days before the halving. This pattern is highlighted in the 2020 cycle with a 19% retrace and in the 2016 cycle with a more pronounced retrace of up to 40% when accounting for downside wicks.Rajagopal Menon, VP, WazirX, said, “After the halving, Bitcoin typically enters a phase of sideways movement, which can be termed as reaccumulation. This phase generally occurs at levels around old all-time highs, preparing the market for the next impulsive wave of price increases. Historical data shows that after the reaccumulation phase post-halving, Bitcoin tends to experience a parabolic rise in price. This pattern is evident in the discussions of post-2020 halving events, where a significant upward movement followed the halving and reaccumulation phases.”Menon further added, “ The general consensus is that prices should go up because of the supply shock but geo political events such as the threat could cause the market to plunge as it did over last weekend.”&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-04-19T22:09:42+05:30"},

This downturn occurred as investors withdrew funds from cryptocurrencies in anticipation of an interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;April witnessed a substantial drop of almost 16% in the value of the most traded cryptocurrency globally. Investors opted to cash in on substantial gains from a remarkable surge, propelling prices to unprecedented levels surpassing $70,000.Bitcoin slipped by 5.6%, marking its lowest point since late February. Currently, it is down by 4.8% at $57,001. Meanwhile, Ether saw more modest losses, down by 3.6% at $2,857, also reaching its weakest level since February.World's largest cryptocurrency's current price stands at a significant 22% lower than March's peak of $73,803, indicating a technical entry into a bear market. Nonetheless, it has surged by 35% since the beginning of this year and has doubled compared to the same period last year, largely attributed to the influx of billions of dollars into newly launched exchange-traded funds since January.What's weighing on bitcoin prices?“As Bitcoin continues its descent from its record highs, currently hovering around $56,550, we witness a confluence of factors driving this decline. The anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision today, coupled with world's largest crypto exchange Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao being sentenced to four months in prison on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to charges of enabling money laundering at his crypto exchange, further impacts Bitcoin prices,” Siddharta Gupta, SVP, Business and Strategic Alliances, CoinDCX, told Livemint.In U.S. premarket trading, stocks associated with cryptocurrency experienced a decline. Shares of the crypto exchange Coinbase witnessed a decrease of 4.6%, while those of mining companies Riot and Marathon Digital saw drops ranging from 4.2% to 4.3%.On the broader economic front, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is anticipated to maintain current interest rates. However, investors are increasingly adopting the perspective that the central bank might refrain from rate cuts throughout the year. This sentiment is detrimental to assets sensitive to interest rates, including cryptocurrencies, emerging market stocks and bonds, and potentially even commodities.Investors have reacted in kind. The ten largest U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs are experiencing their most significant weekly outflow since they were introduced in January.“BTC as an asset class doesn’t trade in isolation and is affected by macro economic factors. With US inflation higher than expected, investors are rebalancing their positions for higher interest rates, for a longer duration. This doesn’t bode well for risky asset classes and hence has impacted crypto prices adversely. Besides this, BTC prices had almost doubled since Jan on the back of Spot ETF inflows and the halving event. The downturn in prices was amplified by profit booking as well,” Parth Chaturvedi Investment leads CoinSwitch Ventures, told Livemint.The much-anticipated \"halving event\" of Bitcoin last month has failed to provide significant support to its price. Following the event on April 20, Bitcoin has experienced a decline of approximately 15%. Numerous investors entered the market in anticipation of this event, which entails a modification to the cryptocurrency's fundamental technology aimed at reducing the pace of new Bitcoin creation.“While Bitcoin ETFs could attract institutional investors in the long term, their immediate impact may be subdued. Many existing ETFs are based on futures contracts, not directly holding Bitcoin, potentially weakening their influence on spot prices. Furthermore, as per historical halving cycles, it's common to observe sideways movement pre and post-Bitcoin halving, indicating a period of consolidation. This is a normal part of the market cycle,” Gupta added.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-01T16:44:29+05:30"},

This event, known as a \"halving,\" occurs roughly every four years and is designed to slow down the overall supply of Bitcoin as per CoinGecko.Bitcoin’s dominance is currently 54.14 per cent, an increase of 0.12 per cent over the day, as per Coinmarketcap data.Following the halving, Bitcoin's price remained relatively stable, experiencing a slight dip of 0.47 per cent to settle at  ₹58,89,117 on Wazirx.&nbsp;The event was highly anticipated by cryptocurrency enthusiasts who believe it will solidify Bitcoin's value as a scarce asset. Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, capped the total supply at 21 million coins.The halving comes after a period of significant price fluctuations for Bitcoin. Bitcoin in March 2024, reached an all-time high of USD 73,803.25 but has since fallen back somewhat. The broader cryptocurrency market has also been buoyed by the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States and the expectation of lower interest rates.What do experts believe?&nbsp;Andrew O'Neill, a crypto analyst at S&amp;P Global, said he was “somewhat sceptical of the lessons that can be taken in terms of price prediction from previous halvings,” as quoted by Reuters.\"It's only one factor in a multitude of factors that can drive price,\" he said.Ahead of the event, JPMorgan analysts expected Bitcoin's price to fall after halving as it was \"overbought\" amid tepid crypto funding, as quoted by Reuters.\"We do not expect bitcoin price increases post halving as it has been already priced in,\" JP Morgan analysts wrote this week.\"The markets have priced in the halving, so there wasn’t any major volatility close to the event. But if you see yesterday’s stark contrast in Tech stock prices tanking but crypto prices moving higher; one can understand how crypto is decoupling itself as a new asset class, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures told Mint.“Broadly prices are lower from their recent highs due to geopolitical tensions, but we can expect near-term downward pressure as Miners and ecosystem participants adjust to the new supply dynamics. The 4th halving brings BTC’s annual inflation to less than gold’s and will further push investors to explore it as a ‘store of value’ asset class,” Chaturvedi added.What does Bitcoin halving mean?Bitcoin halving is a pre-destined event written into Bitcoin's code that happens roughly every four years. It cuts the reward miners get for verifying transactions in half, thereby slowing down the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. This mimics scarcity in precious metals, potentially increasing Bitcoin's value over time as demand remains steady or rises.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-04-20T06:41:53+05:30"},

In just one day the all 9 ETFS accumulated a staggering 6,124 Bitcoin, amounting to approximately $380 million. ETFs now hold a total of 8,24,600 Bitcoin.\"Bitcoin's resilience against bearish pressures has been remarkable. Despite fluctuations, Bitcoin has consistently demonstrated strength, with bullish trends persisting. Whales have capitalized on these trends, consistently buying during market dips. This sustained buying pressure has helped absorb selling pressure and support Bitcoin's upward trajectory.Looking ahead, Bitcoin's trajectory remains bullish, with potential for further gains. Analysts predict a possible breakout towards $90,000, with critical levels around $71,000 likely to be tested in the near future.

SEBI's stance has not previously been reported.Also Read: The curious case of India’s first crypto mutual fundIndia has taken a tough stance against cryptocurrencies since 2018, when the central bank prohibited lenders and other financial intermediaries from dealing with crypto users or exchanges though the move was later struck down by the Supreme Court.In 2021, the government prepared a bill that would have banned private cryptocurrencies though it has not been introduced. Last year, when it was president of the G20, India called for a global framework to regulate such assets.The RBI remains in favour of a ban on stablecoins, according to a person with direct knowledge of the panel's discussions. The person, who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified, added that the panel plans to firm up its report as early as June. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a constant exchange rate with fiat currencies so that they are less vulnerable to wild volatility.In its submissions to the government panel, however, SEBI recommended different regulators should oversee activities linked to cryptocurrencies that fall under their domain and that a single unified regulator for digital assets should be avoided.SEBI said it could monitor cryptocurrencies that take the form of securities as well as new offerings called Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). It could also issue licenses for equity market-related products, said the person aware of the panel's discussions.This would be similar to the US, where tokens that are in the nature of securities and crypto exchanges fall under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Crypto assets that are backed by fiat currencies could be regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, it said.The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) should regulate insurance and pension-related virtual assets, the documents showed.It also recommended that grievances of investors trading in cryptocurrencies should be resolved under India's Consumer Protection Act. SEBI and the RBI did not respond to requests for comment. The finance ministry, IRDAI and PFRDA also did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;FISCAL POLICY RISKSIn its submissions, the RBI said cryptocurrencies could lead to tax evasion and that decentralised peer to peer (P2P) activities in cryptocurrencies would rely on voluntary compliance - both representing risks to fiscal stability.It also said cryptocurrencies may lead to loss of \"seigniorage\" income, which is the profit earned by a central bank from money creation.After the RBI's 2018 orders were challenged by the industry and struck down by the Supreme Court, the central bank asked financial institutions to strictly comply with tough money laundering and foreign exchange rules, effectively keeping cryptocurrencies out of India's formal financial system.Even so, trade flourished and in 2022 the government introduced a tax on crypto transactions in India to discourage such trading. It followed that up by asking all exchanges to register locally before facilitating crypto transactions from within the country.According to a PwC report in December, 31 countries have regulations in place that allow for trade in cryptocurrencies.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-16T15:53:35+05:30"},

The leading cryptocurrency by market value has been impacted by a six-day streak of outflows from dedicated US ETFs.The cryptocurrency maintains a market cap of around $1.2 trillion. Despite the prevailing downturn, Bitcoin's open interest has experienced a slight uptick of 0.59 per cent, reaching a current valuation of $19.1 billion.“The crypto market is currently experiencing a downturn, leaving many individuals feeling confused and scared about their next steps. BTC is now approaching the critical level where many will give up this cycle. BTC is playing much the same role as gold did in the early days of banking.

Gox, the erstwhile crypto exchange announcing the bitcoin cash repayments in July,\" said Avinash Shekhar, CoFounder &amp; CEO, Pi42.What's behind bitcoin's downturn?Recent market sentiment indicates that investors are adopting a cautious approach, refraining from aggressive moves due to various factors that are tempering their risk appetite. These factors have not only impacted the price of Bitcoin but have also overshadowed the prices of the entire cryptocurrency market.Bitcoin's recent performance has been significantly influenced by uncertainty over Federal Reserve interest rate policies. Traders are wary of potential interest rate increases amid ongoing inflation worries. The Fed's forthcoming decisions, especially influenced by economic indicators such as the PCE price index, are crucial for market sentiment.“Bitcoin has been struggling to maintain crucial support levels of late due to some bearish conditions at play. With a steep decrease in high ticket transactions and ETF outflows exceeding inflows yet again, the market sentiment has dampened. Most importantly the strengthening of the dollar index in the backdrop of US PMI reaching an optimistic value of 54.6 has investors biased towards the dollar and moving away from riskier assets. There has also been an influx of profit taking especially from derivatives trades, further dampening investor confidence,” said Rajagopal Menon, VP, WazirX.Another important contributing factor behind Bitcoin's downturn is ETF outflows. A notable withdrawal of $545 million from U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs signals a change in investor sentiment towards digital assets.

Mid-cap companies in India generally possess market capitalizations ranging from  ₹5,000 crores to  ₹20,000 crores, positioning them between large-cap entities (top 100 companies) and small-cap firms (all companies ranked below 250th).Explaining mid-cap performanceIn recent years, mid-cap stocks have been surpassing large-cap stocks in performance. This trend may be attributed to factors such as the greater growth potential of mid-sized companies and investors’ pursuit of higher returns relative to large-cap investments.India’s robust economic expansion significantly benefits mid-cap stocks. This is driven by several factors such as heightened government investment in infrastructure projects, rising demand for diverse products and services, and an increase in consumers’ disposable income. The surge in new retail investors and the widespread adoption of systematic investment plans (SIPs) are key drivers behind the mid-cap rally.These factors also account for the outstanding performance of certain mid-cap mutual funds, particularly over the past five to ten years, thereby enabling numerous investors to generate wealth within a relatively short time frame.Why invest in a mid-cap fund?Investing in mid-cap mutual funds in India can be advantageous, contingent upon your specific financial situation. Here are several advantages of investing in mid-cap funds:Enhanced growth potential: Mid-cap companies are generally younger and in a high-growth stage compared to large-caps. This offers investors in mid-cap funds the opportunity for a greater appreciation in stock prices.Diversification: Investing in mid-cap funds provides diversification benefits by distributing your investment among various mid-cap companies. This mitigates risk compared to investing directly in individual stocks.Professional management: Investing in a mid-cap fund allows you to leverage the expertise of fund managers who actively research and select stocks. This saves you the time and effort needed for individual stock selection.Possibility of higher returns: Large-cap funds have not historically outperformed mid-cap funds. More volatility is nonetheless a result of this.Lower initial investment requirement: Several mid-cap funds feature lower minimum investment thresholds compared to alternative investment options, enabling you to begin investing with a smaller amount.It’s important to remember, though, that mid-cap stocks are frequently more volatile than large-cap stocks. Prices for mid-cap stocks could move more dramatically, so investors need to be ready for potential ups and downs. ;Furthermore, investors with a five-to-10-year investment horizon or longer should consider mid-cap funds. With this strategy, investors can ride out market fluctuations and potentially take advantage of the growth prospects presented by mid-cap firms.This is not to say, however, that you should blindly invest in any mid-cap fund. Choose a fund that has a solid performance history and a reputable fund manager. All things considered, mid-cap funds may be a desirable choice for investors looking to diversify and grow their portfolios. You should, however, be aware of the associated risks and make sure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T09:40:36+05:30"},

Following reports of regulatory actions by SEBI at Quant Mutual Fund’s premises, PrimeInvestor issued an ’exit call’ for all equity and hybrid funds managed by Quant AMC, regardless of their previous recommendations.Building on its most recent guidance, PrimeInvestor emphasised that its latest advisory regarding Quant Mutual Fund was driven solely by the interests of its subscribers and their portfolios.It clarified that seeking publicity was not their intention, as most media attention in such cases is unwelcome and its approach to mutual fund recommendations aims to not only highlight good investment opportunities but also to ensure effective portfolio management, which includes issuing Sell or Hold calls when necessary.PrimeInvestor further stressed that these actions are not about short-term portfolio turnover but rather about prudent management in response to sustained underperformance or unknown risks associated with a fund or its asset management company (AMC). It advocated for moving to alternative options when the current fund no longer aligns with long-term investment goals, underscoring commitment to staying invested in the long run rather than being tied to a specific scheme or AMC.It also advised that alongside the recent Sell call, the subscribers have the opportunity to reinvest in alternative options.\"We curate the Prime Funds list and endorse several funds across various categories with a BUY call. Our assessments are grounded in objective analysis, recognizing that sometimes the available information may be limited,\" stated the platform.\"So, in situations like the recent one, our opinion may come across as a sharp reaction. We’re not saying that risk is bad – we have plenty of calls where risks are high and it’s perfectly fine to take risks to earn returns. But where the impact of an event is currently unclear but consequences grave if it does transpire, we believe it’s far better to protect wealth than run a risk in the name of returns. And tax outflow is a consequence of such risk containment. We do not do the ‘what if’ scenarios to see whether the risk mitigation makes up for the tax outflow. Such an approach cannot work especially when the consequence is a black hole that cannot be measured. As the lyrics from the Wild West song goes: ‘..the secret to survivin’ is knowin what to throw away and knowin’ what to keep’.\"PrimeInvestor also highlighted that its approach is likened to playing a game of chess, where both offense and defense strategies are crucial for winning.What happened with Quant MF?According to SEBI’s surveillance system, there are indications of front-running involving entities that had prior knowledge of Quant Mutual Fund’s upcoming transactions. It is suspected that Quant executives, aware of the size and timing of these transactions, may have leaked confidential information to potential beneficiaries.SEBI’s probe into suspected front-running involving Quant Mutual Fund’s  ₹93,000 crore has left numerous investors anxious about the security of their investments. During its raid on Quant’s Mumbai and Hyderabad offices, SEBI confiscated mobile phones, computers, and other digital devices in an effort to uncover the sources of leaking confidential information for illegal financial gains.What is front-running?Front-running occurs when an individual, often an insider or broker, executes trades based on advanced knowledge of pending large transactions. For instance, if a broker purchases shares in their personal account ahead of a known client’s order to buy a significant amount of stock, it constitutes front-running. This practice is controversial as it exploits privileged information, potentially impacting market fairness and investor confidence.Reasons behind PrimeInvestor’s Sell call on Quant MF schemesPrimeInvestor expressed concern over the risks associated with front-running news, highlighting a dual-risk scenario. Firstly, they anticipate redemption pressures on AMC funds, particularly concerning for Quant, which holds a significant portion of mid-and small-cap stocks susceptible to NAV fluctuations. Secondly, they emphasised that stocks allegedly involved in front-running could face selling pressures, impacting overall sentiment and triggering further redemptions.Given the momentum-driven nature of many stocks in Quant’s portfolio, PrimeInvestor stressed the necessity of exiting these funds promptly to mitigate potential disruptions caused by sudden outflows and ensure investor protection.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

If you’re unfamiliar, front running is a deceptive practice in finance where individuals exploit any advanced knowledge of market movements for personal profit. Here’s an explanation of what it entails:When a broker or someone with access to private information trades security (like stocks or options) before their clientele or the public at large learns of a significant transaction that could impact the price, this is known as unethical trading.Abuse of insider information involves exploiting confidential details, such as knowledge of a substantial client order or an impending firm recommendation expected to influence market prices, to gain unfair profits through pre-emptive trading.Now, let’s illustrate this with an example. Imagine a scenario where a stockbroker is aware that a major investor is preparing to purchase a substantial amount of a specific stock, which is likely to drive its price upwards. Utilizing this information, the broker promptly purchases shares at a lower price and subsequently sells them after the price surges due to the significant purchase. ;What’s wrong with front-running practices?Front running unfairly advantages individuals with inside information and erodes market trust, essentially appropriating potential profits from others. Most importantly, it is deemed unethical for a couple of key reasons:Violation of trust and fiduciary responsibility: In the financial sector, brokers and advisors are entrusted with a fiduciary responsibility to prioritize their clients’ best interests. Front running directly undermines this obligation by prioritizing the broker’s personal gain over the financial well-being of the client. Investors rely on their brokers to act in their best interest, and front-running undermines this trust.Dilutes market integrity: Open communication is necessary for a fair and efficient market. By using confidential information to gain an unfair advantage, front running erodes this. This could cause unanticipated price volatility and discourage real investors from participating, which would be detrimental to the market as a whole.Unequal opportunity: The fundamental role of a financial market is price discovery, where a security’s value is determined by supply and demand. Front running disrupts this process by manipulating prices with privileged information rather than genuine market dynamics. This results in an uneven playing field where some benefit unfairly.Front running, to put it simply, is the practice of cutting ahead of the line and pushing people aside to benefit oneself. It’s a dishonest strategy that erodes confidence and creates an unfair marketplace. In most cases, it is illegal, particularly when it pertains to information about a specific client. However, there can be ambiguous situations, underscoring the importance of transparency and ethical behavior.Should you run away or stay invested?Quant investors are currently facing uncertainty regarding whether to withdraw their investments from the fund or maintain their regular systematic investment plans (SIPs). Clarifying upfront, based on publicly available information, this is a regulatory investigation prompted by suspicions of front-running. It is not a definitive judgment at this point.Despite efforts to encourage investors to remain optimistic and rational, many are understandably concerned about this event and the safety of their investments. This is exacerbated by Quant’s reputation as an assertive asset management company that has consistently delivered top performances across various categories in recent years.Dev Ashish, Founder, Stable Investor explains, “This is not the first time this has happened, just a couple of years back, the Axis Mutual Fund went through a front-running scandal. Before 2021, Axis equity schemes were chart-toppers. But post the front-running scandal, the fund house is still struggling to regain its footing. And it is not just the performance that has taken a hit. The fund house has also experienced a decline in money inflows, reflecting a loss of investor trust in the aftermath of the scandal.”Elucidating on what investors must do, Ashish added, “There is no need to panic first of all. And don’t overreact. In fact, sufficient information isn’t available right now to take a drastic call. Waiting and watching for now may not be a bad thing to do. In any case, how the AMC ran its schemes was highly aggressive and not suited for most investors. In case, investors had some exposure, I guess they would have been wise enough to limit it to a small portion of the overall portfolio. If not, then this is a risk they willingly took by going after returns without looking at what brought those returns. Isn’t it?But if you are too worried and want to take a conservative (but hurried view), more so if you have a high allocation to the fund house and its schemes, then you would anyways be looking at reducing the exposure.” ;This means that Investors with long-time horizons, especially those with ongoing SIPs or STPs, may opt to hold onto their current assets as they can weather short-term market fluctuations and potentially profit from a rebound. Investors who are thinking about short-term liquidation should, however, steer clear of the fund company’s pure equity investment funds to lower risk. This tactic can help lessen susceptibility to changes in the market and ambiguous regulations. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T15:41:28+05:30"},

It speeds up every day, and the only way to get ahead is to throw yourself on the rails and hope for the best. That is, of course, unless you can gain the help of a company such as Aggrandize Digital. This group of digital revolutionists is equipping themselves to catapult their clients straight down the mainline to business success.&nbsp;We caught up with&nbsp;Veerakeswaran Ganapathi, CEO, and Founder, to ask him more about how Aggrandize operates and what inspired him to create such a digital marketing firm, to begin with. He had to say about building a firm that builds up others.Start-Ups are Plunged in at the Deep EndStart-up businesses are thrust in there to sink or swim. There’s no market orientation; nobody calls them aside to explain the rules. So your new firm shows up and fits in or shows up and fails. Either way, if your business doesn’t keep up immediately.&nbsp;Veerakeswaran put together&nbsp;Aggrandize Digital a few short years ago in his home country of India. They were immediately plunged in at the deep end. Off the bat, a new company is expected to know how to build loyal customer bases, create dominating brands, and set itself apart from the competition. He spent years working with other brands to develop marketing strategies that he knew worked; then, he opened his brand. Now, Veerakeswaran spends his days building up other brands with the same winning formulas.The Keys to SuccessAs entrepreneurs, the keys to your business’s success lie in a few different factors. Aggrandize plays to those strengths, highlights them, and places your business on a world stage, ready to perform. They create innovative content that stirs up a buzz around your brand. The bigger the word, the greater the initial reach of your new brand persona.The keys to success include multiple platforms for your business to present itself on. A viable business depends on many traffic streams, not just a single one or a small few. The digital solutions offered by Aggrandize allow clients to connect all the different focal points of their past stratagem into one concrete marketing plan.&nbsp;To catapult your start-up to success, you will need to master social media marketing, engage in website development, constantly up your SEO, produce valuable, engaging content, and even utilize PPC advertising to promote across different networks. It is a culmination of all these elements which will make your business successful, no matter how new it may be. If you drop any of these elements, you can expect to lose that early momentum and forsake market dominance until you&nbsp;survive your first year in business to establish yourself.&nbsp;Start-ups do better with help, and Aggrandize provides that help. It is as simple and as complex as that.&nbsp;Disclaimer: This is a company release. No HT journalist is involved in creation of this content.", "Published_Date": "2022-04-11T17:41:25+05:30"},

Luca Rubino is one of a kind with such an impressive story of resilience and determination to climb the mountain of success. He has built his well flourishing career well before 30, which is quite a task for many out there. Today, he co-founded a successful start-up called Kiri Technologies. He is the co-founder and CMO of one of the most promising sustainability-tech startups, the valuation is currently set at $40Mil. What's more, his success has got him recognition on a global platform with him getting featured in the Italian Forbes' list of 100 Under 30, Top 5 Italian Marketers, and top 100 Italian Future Leaders at the age of 27 which proves the kind of success he has accomplished today.For him the road to success was not an easy one, and he had to face the toughest of challenges while treading his journey. \"There were a lot of hardships that blocked my path leading to a successful career, but that didn't dampen my spirits and I went on to tackle the gravest of situations to reach this point,\" says Luca whose position at present is truly admirable which he has attained by staying focussed and not stepping back due to the fear of failures. This young entrepreneur has managed to do in his 30s, what people take a lifetime to achieve, all owing to his never say die attitude and positive outlook which made him a true success of present time. The vast empire that you see was not gifted but built from scratch, and that's what makes his story worth knowing.He was born in Palermo, Southern Italy, in 1992, into a modest family, having gone through a lot of drama in his childhood as his parents were divorced, were fighting for custody, and he changed 7 houses in the 10 young years of his life. Above that, he lost his best friend in an accident at the age of 16, which disturbed his mental wellness to a great extent. His only pillar of strength, his grandmothers Livia and Concetta who raised him passed away while he was working abroad which was another big hit. Anyone else would have broken down after facing such tough times in life, but Luca instead used this pain and channeled it towards his passion for work to make his beloved ones proud.At the age of 13, he started working in a local mechanic shop and at 16 he was delivering pizzas, in to supplement his income and embrace financial independence. He was far away from studies and was more drawn towards sports. He started off with his local football team and further moved to Milan to enhance his sports career by playing in Italy's first league match. Simultaneously, he continued with his education by grabbing a scholarship in a top UK school, the University of Stirling. Thereafter, he moved to Scotland to pursue a BA of Arts, while also playing football for the school's team.While in Stirling, he realized his mind was getting drawn towards entrepreneurship, and that's what encouraged him to start his first company through the company incubator program offered by the university. He founded Sweet Sicily, an import-export food and wine company, which didn't succeed in the long run. There was no hope lost though as in 2016, upon obtaining his degree, Luca won the Future Leaders, Student Entrepreneur, and Social Impact scholarship which allowed him to move to San Francisco to do a master of international business at Hult, where he also got an opportunity to work with a startup which was included in the 500 Startups' portfolio, and that kick-started his fine career which helped him learn a lot about businesses and entrepreneurship. That stint built a solid foundation which is the base of his present success.In 2020, Luca along with two friends, Mauro Di Benedetto and Kai Schildhauer, founded Kiri Technologies, the first tech startup to incentivize sustainable behaviors. Today, the company's has signed valuation of $40 million, and works around different verticals like Oil &amp; Energy, Aviation, Grocery, Automotive and Transportation.Today Luca lives in Dubai-UAE, a country that in his opinion is setting the example for the rest of the world for safety, innovation and great living conditions given with a great leadership that runs the country.To know more about Luca, connect to his Instagram @rubikingdom.&nbsp;Disclaimer: This is a company release.

FinGrad offers multiple online stock market courses and webinars to learn about the financial market in depth. Moreover, FinGrad is a multilingual platform that aims to reach people from different backgrounds and diversities.&nbsp;&nbsp;With high-quality financial content, FinGrad's vision is to be India's top stock market education platform to make people invest better, increase financial literacy and eradicate a lack of awareness among investors. Due to Trade Brains' increasing demand and success, FinGrad is expected to achieve more than 10 Million new learners within the next 3 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;FinGrad confidentially aims to fulfill the gap between financial knowledge seekers and mentors. Internal reports from the FinGrad research department revealed that there are over 60 Million Demat account holders in India and Lakhs of new accounts are getting opened every month. However, the active participation of the new investors in the market is still very low. Moreover, due to the lack of right financial knowledge, the majority of the new market participants tend to lose money in the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade Brains is aiming to bridge this gap by launching FinGrad, a platform to ease all the problems they face on a daily basis and to educate them about every little detail of the stock market which traditional stock market gurus are failing to meet every day. FinGrad found that there are millions of investors but not a single individual company is providing experienced knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;FinGrad offers multiple online stock market courses and webinars by industry leaders and well-experienced people in the finance industry. Most of the new investors are interested in learning and understanding their stock market technical and fundamental knowledge.&nbsp; When asked about their journey from successfully managing Trade Brains to launching FinGrad, Kritesh Abhishek, CEO &amp; Founder of Trade Brains said, “Every stock market enthusiast should educate themselves first before entering the market, in order to correctly invest or trade and make consistent returns. With FinGrad, we are trying to spread financial literacy in a more comprehensive and pragmatic approach by offering explicit courses and webinars, along with quizzes, assessments, and certification.”&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike any other market, the finance market is full of scams and inexperienced educators without any credibility. There are thousands of telegram channels and social media educators but most investors feel that those wannabe educators and gurus don't offer anything more than basic and misguided information. FinGrad offers a centralised platform with the help of more than 25 instructors and they also have collaboration with industry leaders and experts. FinGrad offers more than 30 courses and webinars as of the launch date that is finely created by proven experts, and they tend to add dozens of more courses and webinars in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp;FinGrad’s premium courses are highly recommended to anyone who is into the financial world. They even offer free courses to everyone willing to master this game without spending a dime. These free courses are ideal for everyone new to stock markets and students and you can also obtain a certificate for every course you pick. FinGrad aims to be India's most trusted and all-in-one financial education platform for everyone who felt overwhelmed and confused after trying out multiple things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclaimer: This is a company release.

According to a recent survey from NASSCOM, around 100 organisations established their global in-house capability centres in India during 2021, and it’s no longer just banks and healthcare companies that are doing so. Increasingly, we’re seeing companies from a much broader range of sectors choosing to outsource critical operations and innovation to India, from retail and lifestyle, through to pharmaceutical and automotive.The survey reports that 1,600 global firms now have captive units in India, with several having more than one centre. All told, these GCCs are employing 1.3 million people, almost a third of the total technology workforce in India.While general job creation is of course good news for the Indian economy, what’s really exciting about this new wave of GCCs opening up is the fact that in the vast majority of cases, these new centres are focused on technological innovation. Rather than the process-driven work that traditionally characterised the offshore or Business Process Outsourcing market, leading organisations are now turning to India to design, lead and accelerate their strategic digital transformation initiatives.Business leaders are recognizing that only India can provide the scale of high quality skills they need in areas of bleeding edge technology such as AI, the Internet of Things and data science.India has become the world’s leading innovation hub and it will continue to cement this position, with NASSCOM predicting that a further 500 new GCCs will open up over the next four years.Heightened consumer expectations heap pressure on to GCCsWith GCCs in India now responsible for innovation for many of the world’s biggest companies, it’s critical that leaders within these organisations ensure they’re able to deliver accelerated digital transformation programs in a sustainable way and maximise return on investment.This is particularly true when set against a backdrop of rapidly rising consumer expectations for high quality digital experiences, all across the world. In the recent App Attention Index 2021 report from AppDynamics, 61% of global consumers reported that their expectation of digital services has changed forever during the pandemic and they won’t tolerate poor performance any more. And more than half readily admit that brands have only one shot to impress them and that if their digital service does not perform, they won’t use them again.This is the environment in which GCCs are now operating – they know that a single IT performance issue can cause significant financial and reputational damage.Indian innovation must not be de-railed by soaring IT complexityHowever, there are currently widespread concerns that relentless innovation is starting to take its toll on many IT departments. In another recent study conducted by AppDynamics, Agents of Transformation: The Rise of Full-Stack Observability, 85% of technologists in India said that their organisation’s response to the pandemic has created more IT complexity than they have ever experienced before.Much of this complexity has been driven by an acceleration of cloud computing initiatives over the last two years, with technologists now required to manage an increasingly sprawling IT estate, across both legacy and cloud environments. This is making it extremely difficult for them to effectively optimise IT performance and ensure faultless digital experience at all times.Even where GCCs have implemented monitoring solutions, most IT departments still aren’t able to get a single, unified view on performance up and down the IT stack. In fact, our research revealed that 86% of technologists in India are still deploying multiple, disconnected monitoring solutions, more than in any other country. This means that they are facing a deluge of performance data but have no way to cut through the noise and turn this mass of data into meaningful insights.Observability is critical to optimise digital experience and drive innovationThe last 12 months have exposed the limitations of traditional approaches to IT performance within new hybrid cloud environments. The reason for this is that within a software-defined, cloud environment, nothing is fixed; everything is constantly changing in real-time. And that makes monitoring far more difficult.Traditional approaches to monitoring were based on physical IT infrastructure – technologists knew they were operating 10 servers and 15 network wires - they were dealing with constants. This then allowed for fixed dashboards for each layer of the IT stack. But such is the nature of cloud computing that organisations are continually scaling up and down their use of IT, according to business needs. For instance, a company might be deploying four servers to support a customer-facing application, but then suddenly increase that to 40 servers to meet a surge in demand in real-time, before dropping back down to six a few hours later.The monitoring solutions currently being deployed within most GCCs in India simply aren’t designed for this dynamic use of technology and they fail when it comes to visibility into applications and underlying infrastructure for large, managed kubernetes environments running on public clouds. And that means that technologists can’t get full visibility of their IT performance in a single pane of glass view.This is why GCCs need to implement a platform that delivers genuine visibility across all cloud infrastructure, from customer-facing applications through to core infrastructure such as network and storage. And in addition to this, they need to provide their technologists with a way to connect real-time IT performance insights withop business outcomes, such as customer experience, sales transactions and revenue.Encouragingly, technologists already recognize the benefits of linking IT performance data to business metrics- they know this is crucial for them to identify and fix issues early before they impact end users, and to prioritise actions and investment based on what really matters to end users and business.If GCC leaders are to achieve their ambitious innovation goals, the onus is now on them to provide their technologists with the tools and insights required to optimise IT performance and deliver the faultless digital experiences we have all come to expect.This article is authored by Abhilash Purushothaman, Regional Vice President &amp; General Manager (Asia) at AppDynamics", "Published_Date": "2022-04-19T10:12:56+05:30"},

Last year, a Pew survey showed that only 11% of Americans see the fast pace of their life as harmful to their health. Still, according to the CDC, out of ten adult Americans six will have a chronic disease — one that might be caused by bad habits and poor choices and exacerbated by the fact that good choices require more time. Eating healthy requires more time as does working out.&nbsp;Dr. Katie To, a wellness and cosmetic dentist from Katy, Texas, is doing her best to help people claw back some of their time, and she does so by teaching people — colleagues and patients — some of her wellness secrets. Powered by a holistic approach to dentistry, as well as health and wellness in general, Dr. Katie To manages to achieve real results.&nbsp;There are many benefits of the holistic approach. “We EVALUATE blood work on our patients, as well as a physical exam,” says Dr. Katie To. “That way we can find out if there are any circumstances that might affect the procedure, its outcome, or the recovery beforehand.”&nbsp;If she finds out the patient has a vitamin D deficiency, for example, Dr. Katie To knows that the patient is likely looking at a longer recovery time. Both the doctor and the patient can then adjust to keep recovery time to a minimum.&nbsp;The holistic approach to health and wellness looks beyond the physical body. Dr. Katie To is concerned with two other types of bodies — emotional and spiritual — that are interconnected with one another, as well as the physical body, and therefore influence one another. “When one of those things is out of whack, everything is imbalanced,” says Dr. Katie To. “Dentistry is more than just the clinical aspect — it’s finding the balance for our patients wherever we can.”&nbsp;Dr. Katie To’s approach to the holistic nature of her practice goes even further. Because of her natural curiosity and propensity to learn, Dr. To is always on top of the latest developments in her industry. That’s why she practices digital dentistry. “We let our patients test drive the smile first,” she explains. “They can have a feel and a look at what they would look like at the end. That gets them motivated.”&nbsp;Some more traditional dentists might have a hard time understanding the quirky new way of practicing dentistry, but that doesn’t bother Dr. Katie To. She sees it as an opportunity to change their mind, which she does through coaching. “A lot of the colleagues I coach, work less without a dip in earnings and are a lot happier and healthier,” she explains. “Whether we’re teaching colleagues or treating patients, with holistic health and wellness we always find the root causes and not just fix the symptom.”&nbsp;Disclaimer: This is a company release.

Jordan | Mint", "Author": "HT Brand Studio", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/ht-brand-studio", "Content": "The majority of people equate happiness with success. While everyone desires success in life, not everyone's end goal is the same. Some people are quite content with a life that could be described as unambitious, while others aspire to be multimillionaires or CEOs of major corporations.&nbsp;This \"unambitious life,\" however, should not be confused with complacency and a sense of security. These two factors are the stumbling blocks to success, as repeated surveys indicate that the majority of people value \"security\" above almost everything else in their lives. People will tolerate jobs they despise, unhappy marriages, and unhealthy habits in order to feel more secure.&nbsp;According to Lorraine P. Jordan, those individuals are succumbing to their fears, and fear is the greatest enemy of success. \"Let’s be honest. People like to believe that those who are motivated and focused achieve success,\" she says. \"The truth is that even the most motivated individuals fail at times, but they will eventually succeed. On the other hand, those who never attempt anything are doomed to never succeed.\"&nbsp;Lorraine P. Jordan is a dynamic real estate professional who leads Team Jordan, a real estate agency team with years of experience and a vast knowledge base in their market. Her Keller Williams team has been the number one group for multiple years in Canada in terms of real estate sold, and they are renowned for their efficiency in meeting their clients' needs. With over 30 years of experience, she knows what the journey to success looks like—something she regularly passes onto her team members.&nbsp;As already mentioned, Jordan believes that a person's greatest foe is \"fear of success,\" and here are three techniques she uses to stay true on her path to success.&nbsp;Define Your Goal&nbsp;While defining goals may appear to be a cliche, as Lorraine P. Jordan explains, having a clear vision of one’s future life is the first step toward overcoming the fears that hold one back. Additionally, she says that a person without a plan is relying on chance, which is not a smart strategy.&nbsp;\"Without goals, it's impossible to create a solid action plan to accomplish what you want,\" she says. \"If you do not overcome this stage, it will inevitably manifest negatively in your life through feelings, actions, and outcomes.\"&nbsp;Visualize Success&nbsp;Nothing in life is perfect. People experience a lot of ups and downs on their paths to success, and that's what makes success complicated. As Lorraine P. Jordan says, when she is confronted with a difficult situation, she closes her eyes and visualizes herself at the end of the road.&nbsp;\"You must be realistic here; envision success with the understanding that it is unlikely to be a bed of roses,\" she explains. \"However, when you visualize yourself accomplishing your objective—when you visualize the end result—it becomes easier.\"&nbsp;Work on Yourself&nbsp;For Lorraine P. Jordan, facing inner demons and constantly trying to improve one’s skills is a crucial component of overcoming fears and achieving success in life. \"Personal growth—improving your soft and hard skills—is not something that comes fast. However, success requires us to evolve and improve constantly,\" Jordan says. \"Growth is a continuous life experience; it's not limited to conquering one obstacle, but when you realize that knowledge is the most powerful weapon in your arsenal, nothing will ever come between you and your success.\"&nbsp;Disclaimer: This is a company release.

SEO entrepreneur and digital landlord&nbsp;James Dooley knows this better than anyone. Dooley makes his living, in part, off this new market through what he calls “digital real estate.” As sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Google continue to grow in size, it is only natural that more people use them to advertise themselves. That translates to more competition for today’s consumers and a greater need for effective strategies that make your brand unique. With search engines like Google being able to access every corner of your life through its algorithms and data analysis, the power of search engine optimization (SEO) has never been more crucial. As an expert in this industry, Dooley’s mission is to help individuals and brands leverage SEO to gain more traffic and leads on their online platforms.After 15+ years in the digital marketing space,&nbsp;Dooley has developed a unique approach that makes him one of the best in the industry. An early adopter of the internet, Dooley developed a passion for SEO in 2008 when his company tasked him with improving its Google ranking. Throughout the project, Dooley studied the Google algorithms and discovered several ways of improving a website’s ranking. Since then, Dooley’s work ethic and enthusiasm for the digital space have kept him on top of the game. Dooley owns multiple online companies that help business owners gain a high return on investment in their digital marketing efforts.Among other roles,&nbsp;Dooley is the founder and CEO of a full-service online digital media and marketing company&nbsp;PromoSEO Ltd that deals with client SEO, lead generation, affiliate marketing, website ranking, and much more. Dooley says that today, every brand wants to be the first one a consumer considers when they want your product, but it’s never that simple. Having a website is the first step, but that alone is not enough. From his research, over 70% of websites generate zero inquiries for their businesses. That’s quite unfortunate from Dooley’s perspective because he knows leads and inquiries are the lifeblood of any business.To sort out those issues for businesses, Dooley’s company operates rank-and-rent websites. In essence, the websites act as traditional real estate. Dooley buys up the web domains, creates quality content for a specific niche, and does all the backend work required to rank the website at the top of the search engine results page. Normally, high traffic generates more leads, which local business owners can leverage instead of trying to hack client SEO on their own. Dooley leases the optimized websites to local business owners for a monthly fee if they want to have the leads and calls generated on those sites. With constant optimization, Dooley says a digital landlord can make more money than most traditional investments would ever bring.To date,&nbsp;Dooley owns over 300 websites. He has invested, built, and retained over 25M webpages he rents out to businesses for lead generation. Additionally, Dooley has employed, trained, and mentored over a dozen apprentices in the UK who have gone on to become directors of different companies. Dooley has also invested in in-house training systems to ensure he achieves his goal of making his core staff millionaires and helping more businesses earn a high ROI.&nbsp;Disclaimer: This is a company release.

As a result, he has helped raise millions of dollars for various cryptocurrency projects. Elvipo's unique approach and expertise make him one of the most sought-after marketing managers in the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;Elvipo’s role in the&nbsp; launch of MetaWeb3&nbsp;Elvipo was the marketing manager during the launch of the MetaWeb3 crypto project. He was responsible for managing the team that created the marketing materials, developed the messaging, and planned and executed the launch campaign. In addition, he also oversaw the community management and social media efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to his hard work and dedication, the launch proved to be a success, and MetaWeb3 quickly caught the attention of countless crypto enthusiasts. Elvipo's experience and expertise were invaluable during the launch, and he continues to be an essential member of the team.

The audience for these reports demands more clarity, transparency and non-financial disclosures. So, the old ways of creating annual reports doesn’t work as well anymore.”&nbsp;Vinay Tanna, a certified Integrated Reporting Practitioner and Report Yak’s Head of Client Relations said, “Even seasoned investor relations professionals find keeping abreast the evolving compliance and regulatory landscape daunting.

Now, the market is looking at the US Central Bank for a hint on the interest rate cut as disappointing US retail sales data is expected to put pressure on the US Central Bank for a rate cut this year.

However, the US Fed members continued their inflation concerns, which enabled the US currency to bounce back and put the precious yellow metal under pressure.Kaynat Chainwala, AVP — of Commodity Research at Kotak Securities, said, \"US retail sales data released yesterday showed that retail sales in the US rose by 0.1 percent in May, missing the 0.2 per cent forecast and signalling cooling consumer sentiment. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, a chorus of US Federal Reserve officials emphasized the need for more evidence of cooling inflation before lowering interest rates. Elsewhere, according to a recent survey by the World Gold Council, more central banks plan to increase their gold reserves within a year due to economic and political uncertainty.\"Gold rate today: Important levels to watchUnveiling the investment strategy for gold investors, Anuj Gupta of HDFC Securities said, \"MCX gold rate today is expected to trade in  ₹71,000 to  ₹72,000 per 10 gm range whereas, in the international market, spot gold price may trade in $2,310 to $2,340 per ounce range.

Reddy, who walked 3,648 kilomeres across Andhra Pradesh on foot as part of his ‘Padayatra’ from November 2017 to January this year, will begin his current campaign from the Gurazala assembly constituency in Guntur district.Reddy’s YSRCP will be looking to defeat the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which is led by AP chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. On 16 March, Reddy will begin campaign by addressing a public meeting. He is expected to tour all 175 assembly constituencies His sister Y.S. Sharmila and mother Y.S. Vijayamma will also accompany him. In AP, both the Lok Sabha and assembly polls will be held together on 11 April.The YSRCP’s campaign this time is also being managed by the Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC), which has built a handful of campaigns over the last few years to target the TDP in AP. From ‘Ravali Jagan, Kavali Jagan’ (we want Jagan, Jagan should win) to Reddy’s ‘Padayatra’, YSRCP has also strengthened its booth-level workers on ground for the upcoming polls.A YSRCP functionary, who did not want to be named, said that one of the aims of the campaign is to create a narrative against Naidu and to target the TDP over failing to get the special status category (SCS) for AP. The SCS, which was promised to the state before its bifurcation in 2014, has now become a matter of political contention.

Escalating conflict in the Middle East with fears of supply disruption in the major oil-producing region also supported the price uptrend.Brent crude futures were last up 78 cents, or 0.9 per cent, to $85.85, having earlier hit $85.89, a high not seen since May 1. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures for July, which expire on Thursday, gained 70 cents, or 0.9 PER CENT, to $82.27.

Coming to domestic prices, crude oil futures last traded 0.91 per cent higher at  ₹6,794 per barrel on the multi commodity exchange (MCX).What's driving crude oil prices?-The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week. Labour market momentum has declined with the overall economy as the Federal Reserve tries to tame inflation. With that pressure now subsiding, a rate cut by the US central bank this year remains on the table.-That could bolster oil prices, which have been dragged down this year by lacklustre global demand. A rate cut by the US would make borrowing cheaper in the world's largest economy, galvanising the appetite for oil as production picks up. Oil prices are also likely to remain supported by a growing geopolitical risk premium driven by conflict in the Middle East, according to analysts.-Israeli forces pounded areas in the central Gaza Strip overnight, while tanks deepened their advance into Rafah in the south. However, expectations of an inventories build appear to be overshadowing fears of escalating geopolitical stress for now, according to some analysts.-An industry report released on Tuesday showed that US crude stocks rose by 2.264 million barrels in the week ended June 14 while gasoline inventories fell, market sources said, citing American Petroleum Institute figures.-A summer uptick in oil demand, refinery runs and ongoing weather risks added to extended production cuts by the OPEC producer group mean that \"oil balances should tighten and inventories should begin to draw during the summer months\", as per JPMorgan commodities analysts.-Investors also digested the latest Bank of England's or BoE decision to keep its main interest rate unchanged at a 16-year high of 5.25 per cent in its monetary policy meeting ahead of Britain's national election on July 4.Also Read: Built-in capacity to targets: Why OPEC+ members clash over oil production capacity—ExplainedWhere are prices headed?Both benchmarks have surged more than six per cent over the past two weeks, driven by outcomes from the recent OPEC+ meeting and a Ukrainian drone strike causing a fire at a major Russian port oil terminal. The potential escalation of tensions in the Middle East is adding supply risk to the oil demand equation, according to analysts.‘’Israeli tanks advanced deeper into the Gaza Strip city of Rafah on Wednesday, while a top Israeli official recently warned of an impending “all-out war” with Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Robust global demand growth forecasts from OPEC, the IEA and US EIA, which all predicted stronger consumption in 2H 2024 boosted market sentiment,'' said Kaynat Chainwala, AVP-Commodity Research, Kotak Securities.In China, recent data showed that May's industrial output lagged expectations. However, retail sales, a key indicator of consumption, grew at the fastest rate since February. The rise in US crude stocks limited further gains in prices.‘’We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile. Crude oil has support levels at $79.65 and $79.10, with resistance at $81.40 and $82.00.

However, the dates of the elections for the state assembly have not yet been announced.On the third day of his trip to Gujarat, where Assembly elections are scheduled for the end of the year, the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) gave a speech at a press conference in Bhavnagar.“In Article 44 of the Constitution, it has been clearly stated that it’s the government’s responsibility to frame the Uniform Civil Code. So the government should frame the UCC. This should be done by taking views of all communities,” Kejriwal said during a briefing.“What has the BJP done? They made a panel before the Uttarakhand elections. After winning the polls there, the committee members simply went home. Now before the Gujarat polls, a panel has been formed, which will also head home once elections are over. Why don’t they do it in Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh?” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief further asked. “If they really intend to implement the UCC countrywide, why don’t they do it at the national level? Are they waiting for the Lok Sabha polls?”Kejriwal has been promoting his AAP as the primary challenger to the BJP and raising the UCC issue.The Election Commission is likely to announce schedule for the Gujarat Assembly polls this week. The Gujarat government on Saturday said it has decided to form a committee headed by a retired High Court judge to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). Union minister Parshottam Rupala had said the committee will be formed before the model code of conduct for elections comes into force. Gujarat Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi had said the decision was taken as per the provisions of Article 44 of Part 4 of the Constitution which expects the state government to apply common law for all citizens. On the third day of his visit to poll-bound Gujarat, Kejriwal welcomed local Koli community leader and social worker Raju Solanki into the AAP, who joined the party along with his son Brijrajsinh Solanki. Kejriwal claimed ever since the AAP has started working in Gujarat, people see a new ray of hope in his party. The Koli community comes under the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) category with numerically significant presence in different parts of Gujarat. Kejriwal described Raju Solanki as a prominent social worker who had helped in the marriage of more than 1,000 orphaned women and worked in the areas of prohibition and education.

The size and scale of this business are small— ₹400 crore in revenue, multiple showrooms, across metros, and so on. On the manufacturing front, the company has all the capabilities and provides top-end products, but while we say that there is disposable income growth, etc., it doesn't seem to translate into that kind of revenue for the company.However, from a market perspective, investors look at the business opportunity and its first-of-its kind, premium bespoke, luxury, furniture maker origin, which is coming to the market.

According to stock market experts, Hyundai India is offloading around 13 per cent of its stake in the upcoming IPO. Still, the giant size of the company would enable the company to generate nearly  ₹25,000 crore, leaving LIC — the biggest-ever IPO of India — by a considerable margin. Experts added that Hyundai India IPO valuations indicate that the upcoming auto stock in the Indian market may outperform its leading peers like Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra (M&amp;M), etc.Hyundai India IPO newsSpeaking on Hyundai India IPO size and other details, Sandeep Pandey, Founder of Basav Capital, said, \"Hyundai India IPO is going to create a history in the Indian primary market as the upcoming IPO is tipped to trump LIC's existing record of biggest-ever IPO in the Indian primary market. As per the company's financials, HHyundai India IPO valuations would be around  ₹25,000 crore. The company is expected to generate a whopping amount by diluting its 13 percent stake. As it is not yet clear whether it will be a 100 percent fresh issue, a mix of fresh shares and OFS or completely OFS, the market is expecting that a major portion of the upcoming IPO will go to the balance sheet of the company, which is expected to enhance its competitiveness against its leading peers like Maruti Suzuki, M&amp;M, Tata Motors, etc.\"On how Hyundai India IPO may affect the Indian auto segment on Dalal Street, Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research at StoxBox, said, “The big-bang and much-awaited IPO from the second largest PV OEM in India in terms of sales volumes is likely to positively impact the valuation metrics of the overall Indian automobile sector. With better profitability metrics and premium positioning vis-à-vis Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor looks poised to further strengthen its position both in domestic and export markets. The company is also looking to up the ante in the EV space and has a pipeline of products to be launched in the next 1-2 years. With the company increasingly focusing on optimizing the overall value chain in the EV space by setting up manufacturing facilities in India, we may see increased competitive intensity with established players such as Tata Motors and M&amp;M.”\"With the PV industry expected to grow in mid-single digits over the next few years, we sense that Hyundai Motor would further strengthen its positioning in the Indian automobile landscape owing to superior financial metrics, premium product mix tilted towards SUV segment, strong parentage of Hyundai, and agility to adapt to the changing consumer preference through continuous R&amp;D and innovation,\" said StoxBox expert.Amit Goel, Co-Founder &amp; Chief Global Strategist at Pace 360 said, “Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki are in the Indian automobile market with the same line of business. A successful IPO for Hyundai could mean increased investment in research and development, expansion of production capacities, and aggressive marketing efforts. This could intensify competition for Maruti Suzuki in terms of market share and sales. The success of Hyundai's IPO could boost investor confidence in the automotive sector, leading to increased interest and investment in automobile stocks overall, including Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and M&amp;M. Investors who are interested in the automobile sector might reallocate their investments based on the perceived growth potential and valuation of Hyundai. If Hyundai's IPO is seen as more attractive in terms of growth prospects or valuation, some investors might shift their investments, potentially putting downward pressure to the share prices. Conversely, if Hyundai's IPO is perceived as overvalued or if it underperforms post-IPO, it could create negative sentiment in the sector, affecting all major players including Tata Motors, M&amp;M, and Maruti Suzuki.”The Pace 360 expert said that Tata Motors and M&amp;M are also key competitors in different segments (Tata Motors with passenger and commercial vehicles, and M&amp;M with SUVs and utility vehicles). Hyundai's IPO could indirectly affect their strategies as well, depending on how Hyundai plans to use the funds and expand its market presence.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts, and broking companies, not of Mint.

This added to the simmering tension between the coalition partners ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, scheduled to commence from the second week of April.Though the Congress tried to retain all 10 seats, the JD(S) managed to bag Tumakuru after it was unable to get Mysuru-Kodagu as part of its pre-poll agreement, giving room for more rebellion within the national party.\"I will file nominations as the Congress candidate on Monday,\" said S.P. Muddahanumegowda, the incumbent Congress MP. He would decide his next course of action if the party did not back him on his decision, he added.Muddahanumegowda’s statements were indicative of the larger problem involving Deve Gowda, who had been scouting for a safe seat after he relinquished Hassan for his 28-year-old grandson.The developments are not auguring well for the parties and its warring workers, who are refusing to work with each other.A large section of Congress workers have already made their displeasure public in Hassan and Mandya from where Gowda’s two grandsons — Prajwal Revanna and Nikhil Kumaraswamy— will be making their electoral debut.A. Manju, former minister and Congress leader, has already switched sides and has been named as the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) candidate in Hassan. Several Congress workers and disgruntled JD(S) workers in the farmer heartland of Mandya have decided to back actor-turned-politician Sumalatha Amarnath or Sumalatha Ambareesh’s candidature, making things harder for Nikhil, the son of Karnataka chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.The BJP on Saturday announced it will support Sumalatha’s candidature in Mandya. “Our senior leaders will sit and talk to him and assuage his feelings and am confident that he will withdraw,” Congress’ working president Eshwar Khandre said.He admitted there was some feeling of discord among workers, but added that the party will manage to convince them to work together. “This feeling will come down gradually.\"Rising differences between the coalition partners and its workers are benefiting the BJP, which has been patiently waiting for such opportunities to help it improve its own footprint in south Karnataka, where it has little or no presence.Deve Gowda’s decision not to contest from Bengaluru North is also giving a breather to union minister and BJP leader D.V. Sadananda Gowda, who has close ties with the JD(S) patriarch. The coalition had a chance to break BJP’s grip over the three seats in urban Bengaluru if Deve Gowda had decided to contest from the north seat.Deve Gowda is expected to file his nominations on Monday.The BJP believes it has a chance to make inroads into the Vokkaliga belt as it stands to benefit from the infighting between the Congress and JD(S). The distrust betwèen the two parties and constantly warring workers helped the BJP get over 2.4 lakh votes in the November by-polls in the sugarcane-growing district, its highest total ever.The BJP also announced the candidature of S.Muniswamy from Kolar to take on Congress heavyweight, K.H.Muniyappa. But the party is yet to announce its decision on the candidate in Bengaluru South, a BJP bastion and constituency of the late Ananth Kumar. Though the party convinced Kumar’s wife, Tejaswini Ananth Kumar, it is yet to officially name her as the candidate from the seat. ;", "Published_Date": "2019-03-23T19:51:54+05:30"},

Lasania", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/yunus-y-lasania", "Content": "Contesting its maiden elections, all eyes in the upcoming Andhra Pradesh assembly (and Lok Sabha) polls will be on the actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan-led Jana Sena Party (JSP). Unlike in 2014, when Kalyan supported the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Bharatiya Janata party ‘s (BJP) pre-poll alliance and didn’t contest, this time the JSP has joined hands with left parties (CPI, CPM) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BJP) to take on the mainstream parties.While Kalyan, who is promising to usher in clean politics, is not expected to emerge as a winner, political analysts say that the JSP might play a key role in deciding the outcome. The former actor belongs to the Kapu community, which holds a significant numerical advantage in the East and West Godavari districts (and in pockets of other districts) where he is believed to have helped the TDP win all the nearly 20 assembly seats in 2014.In the upcoming elections, the TDP, main opposition YSR Congress (YSRCP) and BJP will be contesting alone this time. The TDP, which is likely to face anti-incumbency, broke its alliance with the BJP in March last year. “We are on par with the TDP and YSRCP, and are very strong in both the Godavari districts, also in Guntur and Krishna districts as well. There is a lot of opposition to the TDP due its misrule in AP and you will see some surprising results this time,” said Chintala Parthasathi, spokesperson and JSP’s Anakapalle Lok Sabha seat candidate.Another JSP functionary, who did not want to be quoted, however said that his party is aiming to win 35 assembly seats and is concentrating specifically on those 30-odd segments. “ Jana Sena might not play a king maker, but more of a spoiler, especially for the TDP which had won with our support in 2014 due to consolidation of the Kapu vote. This time since we are contesting, it might give the YSRCP an edge,” he conceded.In the 2014 assembly elections, the TDP won 102 seats, BJP 4, and YSRCP. Subsequently, more than 20 MLAs defected to the TDP and more recently there has been host of defections of both MLAs and MPs between the TDP and YSRCP in the run up to the upcoming elections. In the 2009 AP (joint state) elections, Kalyan’s brother and actor Chiranjeevi had also floated the Praja Rajyam party (PRP), managing to win 18 seats with a 17-18% vote share. He later merged the PRP with the Congress.A senior TDP leader, who did not want to be quoted, said that Kalyan’s party might win anything between five to 10 seats, with a vote share of 10 %. “We don’t know the JSP will fare, and that is the million dollar question. As far as TDP is concerned, we will lose seats in the West Godavari district, and gain in the Rayalaseema region (which is dominated by the YSRCP and a little over 50 assembly seats),” he told Mint, and added that the TDP expects to win anything between the 90 to 100 seats this time.“Pawan Kalyan will mostly win in the East/West Godavi districts, and in pockets of Krishna and Guntur districts, where the Kapu community is numerically more dominant (believed to be about 20% in certain places). So in a close contest that we are likely to witness between the TDP and YSRCP, the JSP contesting elections will make a big difference in about 20 or 30 assembly seats, which might tilt the scales in someone’s favour,” opined a political analyst, who requested anonymity.", "Published_Date": "2019-03-24T18:14:40+05:30"},

This work is never done — there is more that we can and will do,\" WhatsApp India head Abhijit Bose said in a statement recently.WhatsApp, including other social media firms, will now have to process any request from the Election Commission to take down content within three hours during the 48-hour period before voting days.The task is enormous and the stakes are high.\"WhatsApp has been trying to curb the spread of fake news but has got a little success in doing so.

Together, let us reclaim democracy,” KC Venugopal, general secretary and All India Congress Committee’s Karnataka in-charge, wrote on Twitter in the early hours on Monday.The decision to return the seat shows how both the parties were trying to secure a higher seat share to increase their respective individual tally but with limited options for winnable candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.Bengaluru North landed in the share of the JD (S) as it was believed then that Deve Gowda would contest from this seat to help the coalition bag at least one constituency from the clutches of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“It’s too late to take back responsibility,” said a senior Congress leader, requesting not to be named.

The proposed Nyay scheme aims to provide  ₹72,000 annually to 20% of the poorest families, Congress president Rahul Gandhi said on Monday.Not only does the scheme touch a populist chord, it is estimated to cost  ₹3.6 trillion—which is about six times the annual spending on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).Gandhi claimed that the party had been working on the Nyay scheme for the last 4-5 months and held several rounds of consultations with many economists. The first phase of polling for the Lok Sabha elections is scheduled to take place on 11 April.“Congress cannot accept poverty in the country. This is the final assault on poverty. The politics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made two Indias, one is for the poor and the second for the rich. We want one India, where the poor can also live with dignity,” Gandhi said.The Congress president added that MGNREGS had helped 140 million individuals to come out of poverty, and the Nyay scheme will be the second phase of the poverty eradication attempts by the Congress, as it is expected to help at least 250 million individuals to come out of poverty.“This scheme will be implemented in a phased manner, there will be a pilot project first and then the entire scheme will be started. This scheme is fiscally prudent, it is doable and all the fiscal calculations have been done,” he said.Senior Congress leaders said the Nyay scheme will ensure that no Indian family falls below the minimum income threshold of  ₹12,000 per month, and it was just the first economic policy promise of the party for the general elections.Congress is expected to come out with its manifesto in the first week of April.

After facing a drubbing against the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in last year assembly elections (TDP win 2 out of 119 sets), the party has now decided to not contest, and is likely to support the Congress instead, informed senior leaders.TDP leaders from Andhra Pradesh also said that they had been avoiding mud-slinging on Telangana as a state, given that party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu wanted the Telugu Desam Party to be active in both states. “But with us not contesting in Telangana, we will go all out to raise the issue of ‘Andhra pride’ at the cost of criticizing Telangana its chief minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR),” a senior TDP leader, who did not want to be identified, told Mint.The TDP leader informed that his party was earlier contemplating to contest the Malkajgiri, Khammam and Secunderabad Lok Sabha seats (out of 17 seats), but decided against it at the last minute. “There are lakhs of settlers (people of Andhra origin) in those constituencies. And until now, we were not really talking ill about Telangana or the government because it would have been detrimental to our interests there. However, now we will do to KCR what he did to Naidu in the 2018 Telangana assembly elections by raking up the Telangana sentiment against him,” he stated.In the 2018 Telangana assembly elections (held in November), KCR had targeted Naidu constantly in his public meetings by asking people if they wanted “Andhra” rulers again. The Congress, TDP, Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) had joined hands to take on the TRS. However, KCR had the last laugh as he led his party to a stunning victory by winning 88 of the 119 seats, while the Congress and TDP won just 19 (8 have since defected to the TRS) and two (one defected to TRS).Even before last year’s assembly elections, the TDP was severely weakened as 12 of its sitting MLAs (who won in the 2014 state polls) had defected to the TRS, while another had shifted his loyalty to the Congress, along with a huge chunk of the party’s cadre. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy said the Congress has appealed to the TDP for support in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.While the TDP may not be a strong force to reckon with anymore, analysts believe that it still has some influence in pockets like the Kukatpally and LB Nagar assembly seats (in the Greater Hyderabad areas, and which have a considerable chunk of people with roots in AP).“TDP as a party and ideology have gotten sidelined, especially after the TRS came to power again. Things would have been different had the Congress won the assembly elections last year. Currently, Naidu is also facing an uphill task in AP and he would want to focus all of his energy there. If he loses this time, this could be the end of the road for him as chief minister. Coming to Telangana, it is the right decision at this stage for the TDP,” opined political analyst Palwai Raghavendra Reddy.Reddy added that the depending on the political situation later, the TDP can relook at its state and take stock of the party’s Telangana unit five years later.", "Published_Date": "2019-03-25T17:43:18+05:30"},

The Election Commission of India shall indicate the above in an affidavit the basis of satisfaction,\" the bench said.It further said, \"The Election Commission of India shall also indicate that if the sample survey can be extended to a higher level...the affidavit shall be filed by 4PM on March 28. The matter is listed for further hearing on April 1.\"At the outset, the bench told the deputy election commissioner Sudeep Jain, appearing in person, whether the poll panel can increase the number of random physical verification of VVPAT slips with EVMs from the existing stipulation of only one polling station per assembly segment.Jain replied that the EC has adequate reasons to believe that there was no requirement for changing the present arrangement of random matching of VVPAT slips with Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) for one polling per assembly segment.To this the bench said, \"It is not the question of casting aspersions rather it is question of satisfaction. Two is better than one. Tell us, can you do a little more. We would like to increase it. Can you increase it? If you are willing to do it on your own do it but if not then give the reasons.\"Jain replied that the present arrangement of counting of VVPAT slips in one polling booth per assembly constituency in assembly polls and in one polling booth in each assembly segment for Lok Sabha polls has worked well but the poll panel is open to suggestions.The bench was seemingly dissatisfied with the persistent response of the EC official that the present system has been working well and asked the poll panel to file an affidavit detailing the reasons of its satisfaction that there was no need for any improvement.\"If the present system was working well then why did you not start using VVPAT on your own. Why did you need court orders for that (earlier). Why did the judges have to think about it. Why did you oppose the court’s suggestion at that time. You had opposed at that time but yet we did it,\" the bench said.It further said, \"No institution shall insulate itself from improvement, including judiciary. There is always a scope for improvement. Everyone needs improvement\".The EC spokesperson said that in compliance with the direction of the apex court the Commission will file the affidavit by March 28.The bench had on March 15, issued notice to ECI and asked the competent authority to depute an officer to assist the court in the matter.The leaders from six national and 15 regional parties, claiming to represent 70-75 per cent of the population, have also sought the setting aside of the EC guideline on random verification of one assembly seat.The parties include the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party, Aam Aadmi Party, CPI (Marxist), CPI, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal, Loktantrik Janata Dal and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).The plea had referred to the 1975 verdict of the apex court in the case of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi which held that free and fair elections are part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India.It had also referred to the 2013 verdict of apex court in the case of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy where it was held that paper trail for EVMs are an \"indispensable requirement\" for free and fair elections.The plea had further stated that the directions are being sought for giving effect to the judgment of this court declaring VVPAT as \"integral and intrinsic to free and fair elections which, in turn are part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India\".The parties had raised apprehensions in a meeting with the EC in February about the credibility of EVMs, although the poll panel has denied allegations of machines being tampered with.The EC, while announcing the Lok Sabha election schedule, had said that mandatory checking of EVMs and VVPAT will be done on the basis of one polling station for each Lok Sabha constituency.

Though Gowda was himself reluctant to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, the party left with no choice after the Janata Dal (Secular) decided to return the seat for a lack of a suitable candidate.Gowda had led discussions among the other hopefuls for the seat but was finally asked to take up the responsibility with barely any time left to prepare.Gowda will now take on union minister and former Karnataka CM, D.V.Sadananda Gowda of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Vokkaliga dominated seat.Gowda could not be immediately reached for comment.Gowda had unsuccessfully contested the 2009 Lok Sabha elections from Bengaluru South against BJP’s Ananth Kumar.The Congress will now contest 21 out of the 28 seats in the state while the JD(S) will contest seven. Though both parties wanted a higher seat share, the dearth of candidates forcing last minute decisions that could hand the advantage to the BJP.Former Prime Minister H.D.Deve Gowda was likely to contest from the Bengaluru North seat but the former decided instead to file his nominations from Tumakuru (Tumkur) parliamentary constituency. His decision adding to the simmering tensions between the coalition partners and its workers, who are unwilling to overcome past differences and work with each other.S.P.Muddahanumegowda, the sitting Congress MP from Tumakuru filed his nomination on Monday despite the alliance agreement.The Congress is trying to keep the alliance with the JD(S) intact as it would help the party stitch up more such partnerships across the country to help bring down the PM Narendra Modi led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the centre.But its delayed decisions so far in Karnataka and especially Bengaluru is likely to dent the party’s chances. The Congress that won 15 out of the 28 assembly seats in the city had its best chance to gain some lost ground in the three parliamentary seats in urban Bengaluru where it last won in 1999.The party is hopeful that its alliance with the JD(S) will help it bring down the BJP to single digit numbers in Karnataka.But there has been stiff resistance in parts of south Karnataka where the two parties have shared a bitter and violent history. A section of the Congress and JD(S) workers have decided to back Sumalatha Amarnath or Sumalatha Ambareesh’s indpendent candidature instead of Nikhil Kumaraswamy, who they feel was imposed on them by overlooking interests of local leaders. ;", "Published_Date": "2019-03-25T23:10:37+05:30"},

The 2014 voter turnout in Assam was 79.88%, higher than the all-India figure of 66.4%. Mint decodes the electoral puzzle of the state considered the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) gateway to the North-East.What are the social indicators of the state?Assam has a population of 31.2 million, with a literacy rate of 73.18%, a trifle lower than the country’s average of 74.04%. At 86%, Assam is third on the list of states with the highest share of rural population. The state’s sex ratio is 958, better than the country’s 943. Almost a fifth of the state’s population belongs to reserved categories. There is one Lok Sabha seat reserved for a scheduled caste candidate and two for those from the scheduled tribes. More than a third of the state’s area is covered by forests. It is home to several national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and golf courses.What are the burning issues in Assam?For well over 50 years, the key issue in the state has been illegal immigration. There are Bengali-speaking Hindus and Muslims living illegally in Assam and other states, particularly in the North-East. Political parties have said that their migration from Bangladesh has put pressure on the state’s resources, besides tilting its cultural balance. This has found resonance with some sections of the people, for whom arts, music and ethnicity precede religion. The row over the National Register of Citizens leaving out four million ordinary residents in Assam stoked the fire. The register remains a work in progress.What are the natural resources in Assam?Assam has great potential for tourism. The Brahmaputra river flows through the state, which has vast tea gardens. It is rich in oil, gas and wood. Tezpur boasts of the best air quality in India.Which are the main political parties?The Congress and Prafulla Kumar Mahanta’s Asom Gana Parishad were the main political parties. But after BJP captured power in 2016 it became the major player. The Congress is now a distant second, having been discredited for doing little to tackle illegal immigration. Mahanta, a former chief minister who led the Assam movement against illegal immigration in the 1980s, is in an alliance with BJP. So is the Bodoland People’s Front that wants a separate Bodoland. The All India United Democratic Front is a force in Muslim-dominated areas.What is the row over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016?BJP brought the Bill but had to hold it back in the Rajya Sabha, where it lacked numbers. The Bill set 31 December 2014 as the cut-off date for Hindu, Parsi, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh illegal immigrants. Those who entered Assam illegally after this date were to be deported, irrespective of their religion. For others, the cut-off date remained 24 March 1971. BJP felt the passage of the Bill would fetch it Hindu votes in Bengal. Assam and the North-East erupted in protest, but the anger has blown over for now. ;", "Published_Date": "2019-03-26T07:00:18+05:30"},

However, the ministry faced a massive 71% cut in its revised budget estimate, plunging the outlay to  ₹3,579 crore in 2022-23.The marginal rise in the budgetary allocation will not impact the progress of the Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) scheme as its outlay of  ₹4,445 crore is sanctioned for five years till 2027, one of the persons cited above said.The government is aiming to position itself as a textile sourcing and investment destination through seven PM MITRA parts and plans to seek an investment of  ₹70,000 crore in the next five years, this person said.The government is also looking to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) through the PM MITRA and several other schemes.The domestic apparel and textile industry contributes approximately 2.3% to India’s gross domestic product, constitutes 13% of its industrial production and plays a pivotal role by contributing 12% to the country’s export revenue.India commands a 4% share in the international trade of textiles and apparel.To foster private equity investments and boost employment opportunities, the government has strategically introduced several initiatives, including the Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks and the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme.The government is doing several other things as well to help the textile sector.The ministry has added 43 new partners under the Samarth scheme for capacity building in the textile sector, the second official said, adding that it has approved projects for research and development and is spending $7.4 million on it.Some of the major schemes implemented by the textiles ministry are the national handloom development programme, the mill gate price scheme/yarn supply scheme and the handloom weavers’ comprehensive welfare scheme, among others.", "Published_Date": "2024-01-29T23:15:49+05:30"},

Significant strides have already been made toward bolstering pharma manufacturing through recent developments and the signing of MoUs at the Vibrant Gujarat event,” said Nikhil Chopra, CEO and whole-time director of JB Pharma.“I also anticipate the allocation of funds toward enhancing the pharmaceutical supply chain and distribution infrastructure. The government should also consider incentivizing domestic API (active pharmaceutical ingredients) manufacturers by providing them with financial incentives. The finance minister can then stimulate increased production domestically, contributing to a more stable and self-reliant pharmaceutical industry.”The government has already deployed three major schemes for pharmaceutical manufacturing: the production-linked incentive scheme for bulk drugs (PLI 1.0) with a budget of  ₹6,940 crore in 2020, PLI for pharmaceuticals (PLI 2.0), and a  ₹3,000 crore scheme providing financial aid for the creation of bulk drug parks.India is the third largest producer of API, accounting for an 8% share of the global API industry.More than 500 different APIs are manufactured in the country, contributing 57% of APIs to a prequalified list of the WHO.These investments, industry players believe, can be used in tandem with the integration of the latest digital technologies to ensure a streamlined and technologically advanced system.Further, this transformation, they say, would facilitate real-time monitoring, leading to better access and uninterrupted deliveries of pharmaceuticals and through the incorporation of digital advancements, the efficiency and transparency of the supply chain can be significantly improved. Icra Ltd expects the Indian API industry, which had an estimated size of  ₹1– ₹1.1 trillion in CY22, to grow at a CAGR of 7–8% over the next three to four years.“A significant boost in healthcare spending tops our list of priorities. Increased allocations are crucial not only to strengthen our healthcare infrastructure but also to ensure quality healthcare services reach every corner of our diverse nation.We also believe research and innovation is the core of our industry’s growth and allocating increased funds and incentives to what has already been initiated will encourage research and innovation through centres of excellence which will further catalyse advancements in pharmaceuticals,” said Sandeep Jain, joint managing director of Akums Drugs &amp; Pharmaceuticals Ltd.The government has announced several initiatives in the R&amp;D space, including the launch of a new policy on R&amp;D and innovation in the pharmaceutical and MedTech sectors last year.The approved scheme, PRIP (Promotion of Research and Innovation in Pharma MedTech Sector) has a capital outlay of  ₹5,000 crore to transform the Indian pharmaceuticals sector from cost-based to innovation-based with growth by strengthening the research infrastructure of the country.The scheme aims to promote industry-academia linkage for R&amp;D in priority areas to inculcate a culture of quality research and nurture the pool of scientists in the country.In the last budget the government also introduced key initiatives, including the establishing of centres of excellence for artificial intelligence to enhance manpower skills, develop cutting-edge applications, and scalable problem solutions in critical areas including health.The Central government also announced a programme to promote research and innovation in the pharma sector through centres of excellence, while encouraging collaborative research and innovation by public and private medical college faculty and private sector R&amp;D teams through select labs of the Indian Council for Medical Research.Anil Matai, Director General of the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), said, “To further support research to develop innovative pharma products, OPPI believes that the concessional tax rates under Section 115BAB of the Income Tax Act, 1961 should be extended to companies solely engaged in R&amp;D of pharma as well, beyond those related to manufactured articles.Simultaneously, we call for increased incentives for innovation and to attract foreign investment in advanced research.”Section 115BAB of the Income Tax Act, 1961 aims to support and promote the growth of domestic manufacturing enterprises, providing them with the opportunity to pay taxes at a lower rate of 15%.It is also aimed at boosting the number of new manufacturing startups in the space that the government believes to be a means to encourage industrial investment while reinforcing its ‘Make in India’ strategy.Further, to promote innovation within the industry, various measures have been proposed, such as raising the limit for foreign direct investment —up to 100%, FDI is allowed through automatic route for greenfield pharmaceuticals projects—and implementing a new strategy for protecting intellectual property rights.", "Published_Date": "2024-01-30T00:12:57+05:30"},

Thus, this budget is likely to focus on the accounting perspective to keep the government running and any major fiscal decisions will be postponed to the new government. However, in recent years, the government has been making most of the important announcements beyond the scope of the budget.Even as the interim budget may be devoid of policy announcements, it is important to look at the budget from the lens of what the government would want to achieve from a fiscal policy standpoint, that drives the economy towards “Amrit Kaal” and achieving the $5 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) mark. On the surface, the economic landscape appears conducive. There has been adequate press on the resilience of the Indian economy and its high growth performance of 7.3% for fiscal year 2024 (FY24). Importantly, the growth-inflation mix is better now than in FY23 with growth holding up and inflation within the target band. However, it should not be forgotten that the fiscal is also absorbing some of the inflation risks that have arisen in the food sector.However, scratch the surface and there could be some concerns emerging on the growth front, in terms of its quality. This could have implications for future consumption and tax generation capacity of the economy, essential to provide for the evolving expenditure structure of the economy. Notably, one big support to the economy during covid and even after that has been the government’s capital expenditure. Advance estimates on GDP recently released show that the share of consumption has dropped while the share of capital formation has increased in FY24 vis-à-vis FY23. As per the budget estimate for the current fiscal year, the ratio of the Union government’s capital expenditure to revenue expenditure was budgeted at 29%, significantly higher than 14% in FY21.The extent to which the share of expenditure can tilt in favour of capital spending in future years is questionable as the pressure on revenue expenditure is also evident. The interest payments bill has steadily crept up and is currently at around 3.6% of GDP. As a percentage of total expenditure, interest payments are at 24% in FY24 compared to 19% in FY21. The subsidy burden from the food sector also warrants attention: to alleviate the impact of food prices on the lower-income segments of the population, the government has announced free foodgrains to subscribers of the Public Distribution System, thus adding to the food subsidy bill.The government has rarely missed its budget predictions, thereby enhancing the credibility of its budget-making process. And this credibility needs to be followed even more strictly in the future years, given that India gets included in the JPMorgan Bond Index from June, which is expected to bring in nearly $20-22 billion of additional flows through the bond market. The pressure on the government is to adhere to the targets of fiscal consolidation it has laid out, that of achieving a 4.5% gross fiscal deficit (GFD) to GDP ratio by FY26. Our calculations show that the government would credibly achieve the 5.9% target for FY24. This implies that the government will need to demonstrate a consolidation of 1.4% over the next two years, or 0.7% annually. Hence, logically the government would need to target a GFD/GDP of 5.2% for FY25.Here is the risk of attempting any sharp contraction. Private consumption is still not probably up to the mark. And, despite hopes and wishes for a private investment recovery, it is likely to continue to lag given the uncertain demand outlook globally and domestically. Thus, the government will probably have to continue to sustain the boost to the economy through its capital expenditures. In this, it will also have to be mindful of the public debt to GDP ratio of around 85% and borrowing to spend may not be a feasible option. This implies that the government would need to exhibit caution and judiciousness in its spending strategy—especially on the revenue side.The difficult choice would be to stick to its social objective of “leave no one behind”. While the endeavour would be to continue to plug physical infrastructure gaps, the need of the hour is also to provide a push to productivity via increasing spends on education, healthcare, and research and development. This is crucial, as India’s demographic dividend may now be in its final phase, and failing to capitalize on this opportunity could have catastrophic consequences.Indranil Pan is chief economist at Yes Bank.", "Published_Date": "2024-01-29T23:24:03+05:30"},

The finance minister has recently put paid to expectations that the February interim budget would somehow deviate from this protocol. Thus, instead of dwelling on the budget itself, it might be worthwhile to assess how the fiscal books have fared in 2023-24 and how 2024-25 is likely to pan out.For 2023-24, the fiscal deficit is likely to be in line with the target of 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) with the government taking one more step toward getting back to a sustainable fiscal path after deviating sharply in the pandemic period. There has been some overrun in expenditure—higher spends on Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and fertilizer subsidies are examples. However, healthy tax collections, higher dividends from public sector companies and some cuts in expenditure for ministries that have fallen behind the curve in absorbing budget allocations should ensure that the fiscal gap does not exceed the target amount. Moreover, some savings from lower capital expenditure are likely, particularly as states are unlikely to spend the entire allocation for interest-free loans by the Centre this year.What are the challenges and supports for 2024-25? First, it is imperative that fiscal consolidation continues and crosses the next milestone for the deficit of 5.3% of GDP set by the finance minister for 2024-25. Going by any metric, deficits over 5% are extremely high and saddle the government with a growing interest bill that potentially crowds out more productive expenditure. Besides, in an increasingly crisis-prone world, fiscal interventions might be needed to counter unexpected turbulence. It is prudent to create fiscal space by pruning the budget gap as much as possible in more clement times.However, consolidation means less borrowed money that the government has to fund expenditures. The question then is: how can the government fund critical spends without compromising the deficit? This brings us to the key challenge—ramping up the disinvestment and asset monetization programmes that have lagged their targets substantially over the last few years.There might be another buffer though. With several of the Centre’s flagship welfare schemes near completion, the incremental capital expenditure required for them will go down. The rural Awas Yojana scheme (with an allocation of  ₹54,000 crore in fiscal year 2024), for instance, has a completion rate of 85% and is scheduled to end by this year. Similarly, the bulk of the work under the rural drinking water (Har Ghar Nal Se Jal) mission and urban housing (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana—Urban) schemes has been done. While more allocations might be needed to enter the second phase of these schemes, the amount is likely to be small and this might provide some space to fit in other spending heads.What should the government spend on in 2024-25 and beyond? Over the past few years, the government has successfully changed the so-called “expenditure mix” with capex improving relative to revenue spends. This has helped in three ways. First, filling the gap that patchy private investments has created. Second, capex multipliers are known to be much higher than revenue spending multipliers. Thus, this switch to investment spending has helped spur growth. Third, it has helped address the infrastructure deficit, both physical and digital, to enable a more competitive business environment.However, while growth has picked up and measures like the Niti Aayog’s multidimensional poverty index (a composite of benefits both from higher income as well as the myriad welfare programmes such as access to potable water) show a significant improvement in the standard of living in the more backward states, more needs to be done to improve the quality of the workforce. Health, nutrition and education spending is imperative. They often involve spending under revenue heads. A healthier, more skilled workforce is necessary for a pivot toward labour-intensive manufacturing and better paid services.Besides this, two major groups deserve attention. First, small and marginal farmers who have not entirely benefitted from the spectacular growth in Indian agriculture over the last decade (averaging 4%) need more support. Second, greater participation of women in the workforce can be a force multiplier for long-term growth and fiscal policy needs to work toward this. The success of schemes like Ladli Behna Yojana in Madhya Pradesh and the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thittam in Tamil Nadu might provide a template for a more pan-national programme for women’s welfare.Finally, fiscal strategy must take note of the global environment that it is likely to face. India might face headwinds from slowing global growth. However, globally and locally, inflation is likely to fall, taking interest rates down with it. Coupled with the fact that Indian sovereign bonds will be included in a key global bond index, this means that the government could narrow its fiscal gap with much cheaper loans.The biggest risk in 2024-25 probably stems from geopolitics. There is a chance of escalating tensions in West Asia and more muscle-flexing by China over Taiwan. However, these are not the only wars to fret over. The fear of tariff wars might escalate with their invariable consequences for economies, should the likelihood of a Trump presidency in the US increase.Abheek Barua is chief economist at HDFC Bank.", "Published_Date": "2024-01-30T00:07:21+05:30"},

In its November 2023 budget expectation note, Deloitte also recommended PLI schemes for space tech startups to help boost local manufacturing and encourage capability building within the country.Further, given that GCCs have the potential to move up to 1,900 centres in India, employing 2 million people with a revenue of $60 billion- ₹80 billion by 2025, Deloitte hopes this year’s interim Union budget will provide more support in infrastructure development, increased investment in skill development, consistent taxation policies, an ecosystem fostering innovation, and measures towards expansion of export incentives (such as section 10AA of the IT Act, now defunct) to contribute to the growth and success of GCCs in India.Last, but not the least, Deloitte recommends that the government should clarify the meaning of the term “Online Game” in this interim budget, failing which sectors offering and running marketing and promotional schemes or contests online, “might get severely affected with the burden of discharging withholding tax obligation (under Section 194BA, which mandates tax deduction at source on net winnings )”.", "Published_Date": "2024-01-30T00:23:29+05:30"},

That would take the budgetary allocation to more than  ₹3 trillion in FY24-25 from  ₹2.4 trillion in FY24.The government is providing higher budgetary capital allocation to the railways since FY23 to accelerate pace of construction of key infrastructure projects including commissioning of dedicated freight corridors, and speedier trains, as well as modernizing the fleet with new-age trains, wagons and locomotives.Higher budgetary allocation would mean that both passenger and freight rates may be unchanged next year, too, while there would be some reclassification of freight categories.It is expected that increased capex would also go towards rolling out 300-400 Vande Bharat trains in different formats, including one with sleeper coaches, as well as overhauling of the signalling systems. Upgradation of the rolling stock and the need to fast-track modernization of the network for more efficiency in revenue generation are some other aspects that are expected to be highlighted.“As we eagerly anticipate the forthcoming budget, our industry envisions the government’s emphasis on decongestion measures and strategic planning. This would help to foster indigenous manufacturing, and contribute to a resilient and self-reliant Bharat. Rolling stock upgradation and modernization, too, need to be fast-tracked,” said Vivek Lohia, managing director, Jupiter Wagons.The safety budget of the railways is also expected to be almost doubled to help it achieve its Mission Zero Accidents target faster, Lohia said. The allocation for the safety budget has stagnated for the past two years at around  ₹11,000 crore.Another important aspect for the railways next year would be the addition of new trains and to move quickly towards eliminating the waiting list of passengers. The plan, which is expected to be unveiled in the upcoming budget will involve procurement of 7,000-8,000 new trains at an estimated cost of over  ₹1 trillion over the next decade. This would help to add 3,000 daily train trips from the present 10,750.Another plan to add about 50,000 km of new tracks at a cost of  ₹7.5 trillion over the next 10 years would also be launched in the budget with the aim of building a new generation of stronger tracks of 5,000 km each year to run new-age, faster trains.The budget is also likely to emphasise the safety aspect of the railway movement to prevent accidents like the one at Balasore in Odisha last year that resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives. This would involve a signalling recast, switching of the electronic interlocking system for railway tracks to a solid-state system network to reduce human interfere-nce and accidents.Safety additions would also increase the pace of introducing the Kavach rail anti-collision system. The plan is to add 7,000-8,000 km of railway network under the Kavach system every year. A tender for commissioning 6,000 km of railway network is in process.The expectation from the budget is also on announcements regarding completion of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor and substantial progress on the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, covering 1,337 km. This is expected to unclog and increase freight movement, and allow the railways to earn more revenue. The railways is budgeted to earn  ₹1.8 trillion from transporting 2,000 million tonnes of freight in FY24 but this is expected to rise sharply in future as railway networks get unclogged to facilitate easier and swift freight movement.The budget is also expected to unveil the wagon procurement strategy under which close to 30,000 wagons of different designs are expected to be procured by the end of next year.", "Published_Date": "2024-01-30T00:34:12+05:30"},

ExpectsEmphasis on Infrastructure Development: During the pre-Budget consultation, industry leaders and associations called for a greater focus on infrastructure development to sustain economic growth.Support for MSMEs: The industry highlighted the importance of bolstering the MSME (micro, small, and medium enterprises) sector, which is considered a backbone of the Indian economy and a key employment generator.Licensing under focus: Vivek Jalan, Chairman of National Fiscal Affairs and Taxation Committee of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, suggested easing licensing requirements for electronics imports.Labour codes for competitiveness: PHDCCI made recommendations on implementing the four labour codes to enhance industry competitiveness and strengthen university-industry linkages for R&amp;D. “We have suggested labour reforms for industry's progress, we want the tax (rates) to be same. We have suggested that MSME NPA timeline be extended to 180 days from 90 days at present to provide relief to the sector,” Aggarwal of PHDCCI told PTI.Factors for consideration: Samir Somaiya of IMC Chamber highlighted the need to consider geopolitical factors, the pandemic's impact, and climate change in shaping India's economic future, particularly in terms of green growth. “We looked at in the context of the last few years of the geopolitics, the pandemic, we have managed to steer our economy well but now to look at the future, in the context of climate change how can we have India's growth in the face of a green transition and also fueling the growth with green resources,” he said.CII Presented Eights Points for ConsiderationSanjiv Puri, President of industry body Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), presented eight points to Sitharaman for consideration.These included relief in income tax for lower income slabs, streamlining employment-linked incentive schemes such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, and promoting ease of doing business.CII also made recommendations for agriculture and rural development.FICCI’s Focus on Capex and Tax SimplificationTrade association, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry's (FICCI) recommendations centred around driving capital expenditure, fostering innovation, and simplifying taxes.Former FICCI President Subhrakant Panda emphasised the need to support growth momentum by energising demand, enhancing infrastructure development, controlling food inflation, supporting MSMEs, and prioritising innovation and R&amp;D. “We touched upon broader issues (like) primarily what can be done to maintain India's growth momentum and impart further impetus to it. So broadly private sector capex is picking up and the numbers are very encouraging in this regard,” Panda said after the meeting.Assocham's Confidence in Government StrategyAdvocacy group Assocham (Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India) expressed confidence in the Modi 3.0 government's strategic focus on capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.“We welcome the government's emphasis on fiscal consolidation and believe it would proceed with a strategic focus on increasing capital expenditure. By prioritising investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other critical sectors, government can stimulate economic growth while maintaining fiscal discipline,” President Sanjay Nayar said.Pre-Budget Consultations An Ongoing ProcessThis was the third pre-Budget consultation held by Sitharaman and senior ministry officials.

The sector is expected to improve in the current fiscal year because of anticipated normal monsoons and a favourable base effect.Agricultural stakeholders at the meeting on Friday also urged the government to strengthen trade and exports post-harvest management, develop districts as export hubs, establish boards for each agri-commodity under the private sector, and fund global market access programmes.“We have suggested an acceleration of agriculture growth rate through a substantial increase in agricultural R&amp;D up to  ₹20,000 crore from  ₹9,500 crore,” said M.J. Khan, chairman of the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture,&nbsp; “because current challenges and future challenges will have to be met by technological solutions, good agriculture practices, adoption of digital agriculture technologies at a massive scale to enhance the efficiency of agriculture operations and post-production.”&nbsp;Agricultural stakeholders also urged that the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) scheme, an initiative announced in the 2019 budget to give farmers up to  ₹6,000 per year as minimum income support, be increased to  ₹9,000, said one of the industry representatives who meet Sitharaman on Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.&nbsp;“As most farmers are not getting the benefit of this program due to lands not being in their names, the government should consider adaptation of the model China follows,” the person added.In the interim budget for 2024-25, the Union government’s total allocation for the PM-Kisan scheme stood at  ₹60,000 crore, equal to the budgetary allocation and revised estimates for the previous year.“One of the major suggestions to the finance ministry was to deregulate the sugar sector. Molasses plants should be licensed. As we always say, instead of putting up multiple plants, only one plant must be set up, covering a certain distance,” said another representative of the agricultural sector who was at the Friday meeting.MSME’s demand listRepresentatives of the micro, small and medium enterprises sector urged that the productivity-linked incentive, or PLI, scheme be extended beyond the current domains to sectors beneficial for MSMEs.\"We have asked the finance minister to consider issues of bank lending rate (BLR), where credit rating agencies assign BBB- rating to MSMEs because we cannot provide information like market share. As a result, we face higher interest rates on bank loans,” said Sandeep K. Jain, president of the Federation of Indian Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, or FISME.“We have data in the public domain indicating that countries to India’s east will contribute to 60% of the global GDP by 2030. But we have not acted on this,” he said.“The minister was positive about whatever we proposed,” said Murli Krishna Vasireddy, president of Federation of Andhra Pradesh Small and Medium Industries Associations, or FAPSIA.&nbsp;“We asked the government to reduce the fee to file an appeal in the National Company Law Tribunal from  ₹1 crore to  ₹10 lakh,” Vasireddy said. “We also requested the finance minister to give rankings to MSMEs based on the Delayed Payments Act for ease of doing business.”Representatives of the All India Association of Industries (AIAI), All India Dal Mills Association (AIDMA), All India Glass Manufacturers’ Federation, the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Consumers Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association, also met Sitharaman on Friday.Wider budget consultationsIn February, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivered a crisp interim budget for FY25 that reiterated the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation and infrastructure-led growth. There were only a few announcements and no changes to taxes.In her shortest budget speech yet, while Sitharaman conveyed the government’s focus on four key priority sectors—women, farmers, youth, and the poor—she steered clear of populism. The allocation to welfare schemes (central sector and centrally sponsored schemes combined) for FY25 was increased by just 4.7% over the revised estimates for FY24.The finance minister will meet top representatives from trade unions, trade, services and skilling industries early next week as a part of the consultation process for the full-year budget.&nbsp;Friday’s stakeholder consultation meeting included finance secretary T.V. Somanathan, the government’s chief economic adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran, and Union minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary.Among prominent representatives of the agricultural sector and economists present at the Friday meeting were Ajay Vir Jakar, chairman of Bharat Krishak Samaj; C.

They also advocated for incentives, anticipating a budget that addresses critical challenges, stimulates demand, and aligns with the government’s vision of sustainable growth. The sectoral leaders called for the expansion of the SWAMIH (Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing) stress fund and the creation of a second tranche aimed at completing stalled projects and ensuring liquidity. Additionally, they called for tax reliefs for first-time homebuyers and the reintroduction of GST with an input tax credit on under-construction properties to stimulate demand.Sandeep Runwal, President of NAREDCO Maharashtra, emphasised the real estate industry’s anticipation of transformative changes in the upcoming Budget 2024-25. He highlighted the sector’s pivotal role in the economy and its significant employment contribution. Acknowledging past reforms, Runwal called for an increase in the interest rate deduction cap to  ₹5 lakh and a redefinition of affordable housing, particularly in metro cities.He also called for continued incentives for affordable rental housing, tax benefits for first-time homebuyers, and the reintroduction of GST with an input tax credit. Additional proposals encompassing tax reliefs, single window clearance, reduced home loan interest rates, and the revival of subvention schemes for homebuyers.Runwal also advocated for an augmented SWAMIH stress fund, a second tranche with a corpus of  ₹50,000 for stalled projects, and the long-awaited granting of ’industry status’ to the real estate sector.The budget should raise the cap on affordable housing from  ₹45 lakh to  ₹65 lakh, making incentives more accessible, according to Saurabh Garg, Co-founder & Chief Business Officer, NoBroker.com. A revision in Section 24 of the Income Tax Act is sought to increase the tax rebate on home loan interest rates from  ₹2 lakh to at least  ₹5 lakh. To boost real estate investment, suggestions include reducing the long-term capital gains tax on property from 20% to 10% and streamlining processes for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).“Under the current HRA classification, employees residing in recognized metro cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for an HRA of 50% of their basic salary. But those residing in non-metro cities receive a reduced allowance of 40% of their basic salary. This classification fails to include major cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad, where rentals are extremely high. Therefore, we are anticipating that the upcoming budget will address this discrepancy and reassess the classification of cities,” Garg added.Addressing metro city property rates, Pritam Chivukula, Co-Founder & Director, Tridhaatu Realty and Vice President, of CREDAI-MCHI 2023, said, “With property prices in metro cities skyrocketing, the industry advocates for a revision of the cap in the credit link subsidy scheme. Raising the limit from  ₹45 lakh to  ₹1 crore for metro city home buyers will significantly benefit the affordable housing segment, making homes more accessible.”\"We support the industry-wide call for granting \"industry status\" to the residential sector, aligning with the government’s vision of \"housing for all.\" Additionally, supportive measures, including NAREDCO’s appeal for a  ₹50,000-crore fund, will also align with the government’s vision of \"housing for all\" and could significantly fortify the sector’s trajectory. The budget is a chance to redefine affordability as the diverse locations demand different price caps instead of uniformity.

So, it is advisable to spot opportunities in great businesses at good valuations, says Trupti Agrawal, Fund Manager, WhiteOak Capital AMC, in an email interview with MintGenie.She also shares her views on the expectations from Budget 2024. With regards to the&nbsp; interim Budget 2024, she believes that the government's allocation is expected to increase in railways, roadways and housing.Investing in India, she believes, remains as compelling as ever. In view of the prevailing positive sentiment in financial services and pharma &amp; healthcare, WhiteOak AMC has launched a scheme in each of these categories.She also asserts that largecaps – as a segment – have become more attractive.&nbsp;Edited Excerpts:Stock prices are believed to be overpriced; what advice do you have for investors? Should they stay invested or go for some profit booking?Taking an investment decision based on near-term valuations/market levels amounts to market timing. Our fundamental, long-held belief has been that in the short term, the direction of equity markets is impossible to predict, hardly any different than a coin flip.&nbsp;The most exciting part about the Indian market is the potential to generate alpha and thus the opportunity cost of market timing is also very high. Thus, from a prudent risk management perspective, we continue to stay fully invested at all times with a bottom-up approach to investing in great businesses at attractive valuations.&nbsp;This does not imply a passive buy and hold approach but an active assessment of opportunities. Irrespective of market levels, at every point in time there will be companies which will be relatively undervalued, and our portfolio will reflect some of these new ideas, if they meet our framework of great business.The interim Budget 2024 is around the corner. What are your expectations from it relating to the proposed exemptions and major changes in tax rates, etc.?&nbsp;Traditionally, interim budgets do not have major tax related reforms/ announcements. &nbsp;Thus, any major change is unlikely although one can expect some tinkering with standard deduction or exemption limits in order to incentivise taxpayers into joining the new tax regime.&nbsp;How is the broader market expected to behave in this year? Do your expect some correction to happen soon after the budget or post elections?We continue to live in an environment characterised by unfavourable inflation dynamics at a global scale, slowing Chinese economy, persistently high geo-political risks, and an aftermath of the pandemic in many ways. India appears to be better placed, on a relative basis due a favourable macroeconomic environment, stable political regime and the resilience demonstrated by the economy during the stress test of the Covid crisis, and hence a faster rebound thereafter. The fundamental case for investing in India remains as compelling as ever if not stronger.We have always believed that in the very near term, the market movement is impossible to predict. Apart from the budget, there are many global and domestic events, including the ongoing corporate earnings season which will have an impact on the markets.As far as the general elections 2024 are concerned, most investors will view recent state election outcomes positively in anticipation of reduced policy and political risks into 2024.Can you tell us about the sectors/themes that are likely to do well this year? Has WhiteOak launched any sectoral mutual funds to capitalise on the positive sentiment in these sectors?&nbsp;India is benefitting from several secular tailwinds. A potential multi-decade growth opportunity is unfolding as per capita incomes rise, creating inflection points for various categories where India is at the lower end of the consumption curve.&nbsp;Additionally, the country is experiencing rapid digitalisation and formalisation on the back of massive investments and crucial and ongoing structural reforms.&nbsp;There are a host of sectors which will stand to benefit from the above tailwinds. Leveraging the expertise of our well-resourced and experienced investment team we have recently launched two new funds to provide our investors an opportunity to invest in two of the key multi-year growth themes in the Indian equity markets - ‘WhiteOak Capital Banking &amp; Financial Services Fund’ and ‘WhiteOak Capital Pharma and Healthcare Fund’. &nbsp;What are your views on the sectors that are likely to get an impetus in the interim budget?The last few budgets have laid the stress on sustainable growth while signalling policy continuity with a thrust on public capex, enhancing the ease of doing business and boosting exports and manufacturing. This interim budget is unlikely to alter that direction. When it comes to capex, government’s push for infrastructure could see railway &amp; roadways receiving a healthy allocation. Similarly, housing sector may receive a boost.&nbsp;What are your views on the high valuation of small and mid-cap stocks? Should retail investors stay away from them for the time being?&nbsp;Although it is impossible to forecast the near-term relative performance of market segments, given the strong returns that SMIDs have generated in 2023, largecaps as a segment have become relatively more attractive from a valuation stand-point. It is also true that some pockets of mid and small-caps may look overstretched as far as valuations are concerned and will appear attractive if the anticipated economic growth in India comes through.&nbsp;It is fair to stay fully invested, but expectation going forward should be low double-digit return.", "Published_Date": "2024-01-31T15:03:16+05:30"},

Gyanchandani", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/ca-rohit-j.-gyanchandani", "Content": "Tax harvesting involves strategically selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains and reduce tax liability. By realising losses, investors can decrease their taxable income, potentially saving money on taxes. This technique is commonly used to optimise investment portfolios.Tax harvesting is a strategy used by investors to maximise tax benefits, particularly concerning long-term capital gains (LTCG). Before 2018, there was no tax imposed on LTCG. However, when the government introduced this tax, they provided a small benefit: capital gains up to  ₹1 lakh are tax-free in case of equities.However, many investors find it challenging to fully utilise this  ₹1 lakh exemption. In India, taxes are levied on realised profits, meaning the gains must be actualized through the sale of assets. This poses a dilemma for investors whose portfolios have accrued significant profits but haven't yet sold their assets to realise these gains.Also Read: How to harvest tax-free capital gains from stocks and equity oriented mutual funds?Here's where tax harvesting comes into play:&nbsp;Let's consider an example: Shubham has been holding onto his stocks for three years, and his long-term capital gain amounts to  ₹3 lakhs. Deducting the  ₹1 lakh exemption, he is left with  ₹2 lakhs, on which he would have to pay a 10% tax, amounting to  ₹20,000.&nbsp;On the other hand, suppose another investor, let's call him Varun, adopts the tax harvesting strategy. Varun sells a portion of his profit-making shares every year, realising his LTCG annually. By doing so, Varun effectively resets the cost basis of his investments each year, ensuring that his gains remain within the  ₹1 lakh exemption limit. Therefore, even after three years, when Varun’s total LTCG amounts to  ₹3 lakhs, he owes no tax because he has systematically realised and reinvested his gains each year.In essence, tax harvesting involves periodically selling profitable investments to lock in gains and then immediately repurchasing them. This strategy allows investors to spread their gains over multiple years, making the most of the tax exemption limits and minimising their overall tax liability. By implementing tax harvesting, investors can optimise their tax planning efforts while maximising their investment returns in a tax-efficient manner.Also Read: Your Questions Answered: How does tax-loss harvesting work and can it minimise my tax outgo?Carry Forward LossesCarry forward losses refer to business or investment losses that can be used to offset future profits for tax purposes. These losses are not immediately deductible but can be carried forward to reduce taxable income in future years, providing a valuable tax-saving strategy for individuals and entities.When it comes to taxes, it's common to feel overwhelmed, especially if you've experienced losses in your investments. Let's consider a scenario where someone, let's call them Varun, incurred a loss of  ₹1 lakh in the stock market. Feeling disheartened, Varun decides not to file a tax return, assuming that since he incurred a loss, he doesn't owe any taxes. However, this assumption is incorrect, and here's why:&nbsp;The Income Tax Act provides two important concepts:&nbsp;1. Set Off: Set off allows taxpayers to offset their losses against any profits they may have made in the same financial year. For instance, if Varun had any business or capital gains during the year, he could set off his losses against those gains, effectively reducing his taxable income. There are specific rules regarding which types of losses can be set off against which types of gains, such as long-term capital losses can only be set off against long-term capital gains, and so on.Also Read: Is 80D Deduction the Only Way to Save Tax for Insurance Holders2. Carry Forward: In cases where taxpayers have losses but no profits to set them off against, the Income Tax Act allows for the carry forward of losses. This means that Varun can carry forward his  ₹1 lakh loss for up to eight years. If he earns profits in any of the subsequent years, he can offset those profits with the carried forward loss, thereby reducing his tax liability in those years.However, here's the crucial point that Varun missed: In order to avail of the benefit of carry forward, it is imperative to file an income tax return. If Varun chooses not to file a return, he forfeits the opportunity to carry forward his losses, potentially missing out on significant tax benefits in the future.Therefore, while incurring losses may seem discouraging, it's essential to understand the provisions of set off and carry forward provided by the Income Tax Act. By filing an income tax return and utilising these provisions effectively, taxpayers like Varun can minimise their tax burden and make the most of their investments in the long run.Also Read: Income Tax Return: 5 lesser-known tax-saving tips from Section 80In conclusion, tax harvesting and carrying forward losses are powerful strategies to optimise tax liabilities. Tax harvesting involves selling investments at a loss to offset gains, thereby reducing taxable income. Carry forward losses allow unused losses to be deducted from future gains, further reducing taxes. In conclusion, these tactics offer valuable opportunities for investors to manage their tax burdens efficiently while enhancing overall portfolio performance.Rohit Gyanchandani is Managing Director at Nandi Nivesh Private Limited", "Published_Date": "2024-05-21T08:49:28+05:30"},

In addition to pay, arrears may involve other sources of income. A comprehensive list of what qualifies as arrears for tax purposes is provided below:Any unpaid bonuses, allowances, or back pay are included in the salary.Arrear income is defined as lump sum payments made to make up for missed pension instalments.In the year that it is received, back rent from tenants who withheld payments in previous months is regarded as income.Interest payments are taxable in the year they are received if they are made over a longer period.Any income, such as dividends, royalties, or contractual payments, that you were entitled to receive the prior year but were not paid on time or were withheld is considered arrears when it is received.Your total revenue will rise if you receive a significant amount of arrears this year. You may be placed in a higher tax bracket as a result of this than you otherwise would have been. Consequently, a larger portion of your income is subject to a higher tax rate, increasing your overall tax obligation.Also Read:&nbsp;Income Tax: Make note of these 5 key points if you are a salaried taxpayerThe important thing to remember is that even if these payments relate to money you were supposed to receive earlier, the tax authorities will count them as income for the year in which they are received. You might end up in a higher tax bracket this year as a result of this.Here’s why receiving arrears or additional payments can increase your tax liability:Tax is calculated on total income: Income tax is determined based on your total taxable income for the year.Arrears are added to current income: Received arrears are applied to current year earnings.Tax brackets have thresholds: Tax brackets define income ranges with different tax rates. As your income increases, you may move into a higher tax bracket, resulting in a higher tax rate on the additional income.Also Read:&nbsp;Income Tax: Filing ITR early this time?

It talks about the potential for your tax burden to go up if you fall behind on your payments and have to make additional payments.This is the relief provided by Section 89(1):Recalculates tax for both years: The tax is recalculated for the year that the arrears are received and the year that they relate to when you make a claim for relief under this provision.Lessens the tax liability: This recalculation ensures that the delay in receiving your income does not result in you having to pay additional taxes. Rather, you will pay the tax that you would have paid in the first year if you had received the income.Fill out Form 10E and send it in with your income tax return to get this relief. It is advised that you seek guidance from a tax advisor regarding the specific requirements and the proper application of Section 89(1) to your situation.Also Read:&nbsp;Income Tax: How to authenticate notice issued by the department?

Nonetheless, seniors receive significant tax breaks under income tax regulations. The individual must be 60 years of age or older but not older than 80 at any point during the year to qualify for these benefits.A senior or super senior who earns more than the exemption amount is still required to pay taxes even though they are not required to file an income tax return (ITR). The exemption does not cover the actual tax liability; it only applies to filing the return.Also Read: I-T Dept Issues Reminder: Link PAN with Aadhaar by May 31 to avoid higher TDS; here's howTogether with income from other sources, the pension income is primarily responsible for taxes. But take note that government commuted pension income—that is, income that is immediately payable in a lump sum—is completely exempt from all taxes. Uncommuted pension income is subject to the relevant marginal slab rates and is taxable under the “Salaries” heading.The taxation of commuted pension income from private businesses falls under the “Salaries” category, and the relevant tax rates apply.Higher exemption limitsInvestments in tax savings made by March 31, 2024, will be included in income tax returns for the 2023–2024 fiscal year. Benefits like Section 80C for interest income and health insurance premiums are eliminated under the new tax law. There are still benefits from the previous regime in many areas.Senior citizens looking to pay off their tax liabilities first focus on their income sources. Take into account all of your income sources, including your salary, pension, fixed deposit income, interest from savings accounts, rent from rental properties, capital gains from investments, and so forth.Also Read: Income Tax: Filing ITR early this time? Here are 8 key strategies to optimise tax savingsSuppose an individual's total income is less than a certain threshold ( ₹5 lakhs in the previous tax regime and  ₹7 lakhs in the current tax regime). In that case, they are also eligible for a tax rebate under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act. The rebate would equal  ₹12,500 (or, in the event of a new tax regime,  ₹25,000), less the actual tax amount.Senior citizens have higher deduction limits and exemption benefits than younger taxpayers. The primary difference lies in the basic exemption ceiling, which denotes the maximum amount that is exempt from taxes. For instance, the maximum for older adults (60–80 years old) is currently  ₹3 lakh, while the maximum for younger adults ( ₹2.5 lakh) is  ₹2.5 lakh.Their taxable income is directly decreased by this higher exemption level. The total income less the exemption cap and any relevant deductions is the taxable income. A greater exemption level means that a greater portion of their income is not subject to taxes.Also Read: National Pension System: 7 strategic insights for tax-efficient retirement savingMore deductions available for senior citizensSimilarly, there are more possible deductions.Section 80D: Seniors who may have greater medical expenses should take advantage of the premium deductions for health insurance. Compared to younger taxpayers, they are eligible for higher deduction limitations under Section 80D.Section 80TTB: Up to a certain amount, interest income from deposits may be deductible under this section. Seniors, who usually depend on interest income from savings accounts and fixed deposits, may find this especially helpful.Section 80C: This section allows for the deduction of investments made in various tax-saving options. Senior citizens can benefit from this by investing in plans such as the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS), which offers competitive interest rates and is eligible for Section 80C deductions.Seniors' taxable income is calculated by taking their total income and subtracting any applicable exemptions and deductions. This yields their taxable income. Below is a summary of the process:Step 1: Calculate the total income. This includes any income the senior citizen receives from sources like:Pension earningsInterest earned on investments, such as savings accounts and fixed depositsRevenue from other sources (business revenue, capital gains, etc.) in addition to rental incomeStep 2: Benefit from available deductions. Many deductions are available to senior citizens under various sections of the Income Tax Act. Several typical ones are:Section 80D: Premium deductions for health insurance (usually with higher caps for seniors)Section 80TTB: Up to a predetermined maximum, interest income from deposits is deductible.Section 80C: Investment deductions for a range of tax-saving strategies, such as the beneficial SCSS.Step 3: Compared to younger taxpayers, senior citizens enjoy a higher basic exemption level.The current exemption limit for senior folks (aged 60 to 80 years) is  ₹3 lakhs.Older people (80 years of age and above) are eligible for an even higher exemption ceiling (currently  ₹5 lakh).Step 4: Calculate your taxable income.Deduct from the total income (Step 1) the appropriate deductions claimed under various sections (e.g., 80D, 80TTB, and 80C).Use the exemption limit (Rs. 3 lakh or Rs. 5 lakh) based on the senior citizen's age.It is taxable income if the remaining sum after deductions is greater than the exemption threshold.Essentially, seniors' taxable income is reduced by a combination of higher exemption limits and additional deductions. This means they may be able to keep more of their retirement income and pay less in taxes overall.Also Read: ITR Filing FY24: 6 key points taxpayers must know as July 31 deadline looms largeNext, there is the cessation of health education and the surcharge.

However, even in such a massive movement, the maximum loss was limited to  ₹5,300 per lot in Short Iron Fly and  ₹3,050 per lot in Short Iron Condor strategies, due to strategic hedge placed on Out of Money (OTM) wings, as long positions,” he added.Overall, the analyst feels that short Iron Condor or Short Iron Fly is a good way of playing vega exposure on the Budget day.Read Budget 2024 Parliament Session Live Updates hereDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

Coalition politics, however, could make it more challenging to pass legislation on the more ambitious parts of the government reform agenda in areas like agriculture, land, labour and judicial, which are usually out of budgets,\" said brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Motilal observed that the mandate of the BJP in NDA-II (starting FY25) is much stronger than during NDA-I, which was quite visible in the Cabinet allocation, wherein the BJP retained most of the high-profile departments with their ministers (such as home, defence, finance, external affairs, road transport and highways, among others).\"During the past decade, the BJP has very carefully created an image of a clean government, minimising wasteful spending and corruption, making the Budget more transparent by reducing off-budget expenditure/borrowings, leading to higher capex (capital expenditure) allocation, and resisting calls for large rural support, and maintaining fiscal prudence,\" said Motilal Oswal.Also Read: Budget 2024: Will Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman increase income tax exemption limit?In Budget 2025, Motilal believes that the new government will largely retain its tax and non-debt capital receipt projections, including disinvestment, as presented during the Interim Budget in February.In that case, the RBI's transfer of  ₹2.11 lakh crore will result in excess receipts of about  ₹1.5 lakh crore in FY25. According to Motilal Oswal, a large portion of these additional receipts could be spent under various heads, while a small portion could be used to reduce the fiscal deficit.\" ₹30,000-40,000 crore could be utilised to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5 per cent of GDP, from the 5.1 per cent of GDP announced in the Interim Budget,\" said the brokerage firm.Also Read: Budget 2024: What should be your trading strategy ahead of FM's announcement?Moreover, one way to spend additional resources could be to provide more capex-related loans to states, improving the Center’s total capital spending (including loans and advances).\"The Center budgeted  ₹1.4 lakh crore to states and UTs as loans and advances in FY25 in the Interim Budget, which could be increased by  ₹30,000-40,000 crore,\" said Motilal.Increasing its focus on the agriculture sector, if the government decides to revise the instalments under PM-KISAN by 50 per cent to  ₹9,000 per annum, it would cost the exchequer another  ₹30,000 crore, according to Motilal Oswal.Also Read: Budget 2024: A look at what corporate India expects from FM Nirmala Sitharaman — tax relief, higher capex &amp; moreThe Union Government may use the remaining  ₹50,000 crore to provide some more incentives to the taxpayers to shift to the new tax regime and expand on housing schemes or various other schemes.\"Overall, we do not expect the government to divert from its fiscal deficit consolidation path while improving the quality of fiscal spending. It is, however, very likely that fiscal spending could be increased due to higher receipts led by the RBI dividend,\" said the brokerage firm.Motilal sees little chance that the upcoming state assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana, and Jharkhand will influence the upcoming budget allocations. This is because the voting patterns in state and general elections tend to be very different.Another key point highlighted by the brokerage firm is that while advocates for a rural economy package may cite the BJP's poor performance in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra in the last Lok Sabha election to support their case, the party's significant victories in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh show that voter behaviour is influenced by a variety of factors.Moreover, the brokerage firm said it is highly unlikely that tax incentives for the middle-class and poor Indians would be seen by voters in the election-bound states as exclusive policies for them. A list of a large package of freebies, which was included in the Congress manifesto but was largely absent in the BJP manifesto, reflects the maturity of voters in the country.Motilal believes the results of the Maharashtra assembly elections would be largely driven by state politics rather than national policies.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts, and brokerage firms, not Mint.

However, he added that a relaxation or reduction in capital gains taxes is quite unlikely. Commenting on strategy for budget, he advises rebalancing only if one is extremely overweight in one or two sectors and underweight in other sectors.&nbsp;Edited Excerpts:What should retail investors expect from the upcoming Budget?The upcoming first Budget of the Modi 3.0 government is expected in July, and as always, hopes run high amongst all, be it the investors, traders, corporations or the common citizens. The budget is likely to be focused on job creation, taming inflation, infrastructure development, incentives for the manufacturing sector, a major thrust for the agriculture sector, and most probably, taxation relaxation for certain sections of the taxpayers, primarily those in the lower income tax slabs, to provide more money in the hands, so as to further bolster spending. As far as retail investors are particularly concerned, a relaxation or reduction in charges is quite unlikely, but let’s keep a wait-and-watch policy.Do you see the government tinkering with capital gains tax in any way?Taxation plays a very important role when it comes to channelising funds into any asset class and tinkering with capital gains tax, that is, a reduction of any kind will be a very welcome step, given that overall taxation rates are higher in India, as compared to many other countries. So, yes, a reduction in the capital gains tax will be looked upon favourably by both domestic and international investors and could go a long way, in creating a more vibrant stock market, in years to come.What new announcement do you expect from this Budget?This budget could turn out to be one of the most important Budgets of recent times, because the government is saddled with the twin objectives of job creation and sustaining the growth of the Indian economy, despite the global headwinds emanating on account of the Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Gaza conflict, higher energy prices, inflationary challenges, just to name a few. Also, all eyes will be on the government this time, as this will be the first time after a decade that it will be budgeted by a coalition government, though BJP still is in the command. So, that’s definitely keeping investors on their toes. However, reduction in taxation slabs, push for defence and infra, and incentives for MSME and agriculture, are a few areas that ideally will be on the radar of the government.Which sectors will be the focus of the Budget? Will auto, banks see a push?Most of the sectors including the likes of auto, banking, pharma, infra, defence, power and green energy, fintech &amp; IT, agriculture &amp; allied, are likely to be at the forefront of the budget expectations, as these sectors play a very critical role in the overall development of any economy. Hence, investors would have a keen eye as to what’s delivered in the Budget for these sectors, and also, with India’s GDP expected to grow anywhere between 7 and 8 percent per annum over the next decade, all these sectors shall witness a multiplier effect growth.Do you see interest rates declining in 2023 with the CPI under control?There is a very high probability that the RBI could be ahead of the curve this time than the US Fed when it comes to cutting interest rates. Inflation continues to be a downward trajectory, with the benchmark CPI cooling off to stay below the 5% mark, which bodes well for the future. It is also pertinent to ensure that the inflation stays sub 5% and the current monsoon continues on its normal path, as any disruption of the same could lead to a rethink by the RBI.What are some headwinds that Indian markets have to battle in the second half of 2024?The second half of 2024 is likely to be very eventful, given the fact that the US Presidential elections are scheduled for November, and it would have a major bearing, not only on the US markets but the global markets as well. So, this is one major event, that investors should keep a close watch on. Further, the current ongoing global conflicts till such time do not escalate, markets appear to have factored them well, but any change in the severity of the same could have a negative impact. Apart from these, energy prices, inflation trajectory &amp; US Fed stance on rates, are a few other crucial data points that one needs to keep a sharp eye on.How do you advise investors to rebalance their portfolios? What should they add/reduce?Investors should always ensure that their overall portfolio is well diversified amongst various sectors, with stocks from the financials and banking, auto, infra, energy, pharma and IT, to name a few. Further, it is very pertinent to be evenly distributed and stick to the leaders of these sectors and those stocks, which are in no way, connected with any controversy or negative news, as that can have a significant bearing on the overall performance of the portfolio. So, a rebalancing is only suggested if one is extremely overweight in one or two sectors and underweight in other sectors. Striking a balance is essential, or to put it this way, depending upon the risk appetite, one can either look at mirroring the sectoral percentages as per Nifty, else look at investing in mutual funds or ETFs, where there is sufficient diversification.  What retail investor trends should one watch out for in the remainder of 2024?Retail investors need to be alert and cautious going forward in the second half of 2024, as markets trade at record highs, and it becomes exceedingly difficult to identify stocks at decent valuations in the current market scenario. So it becomes very pertinent that retail investors keep it light as they proceed, and they should look at adding onto quality stocks only on decent corrections, and in all circumstances, stay from stocks which are just the flavour of the season and those stocks &amp; companies which have not seen both sides of the markets, that is the bull and the bear market. One piece of advice for new investors?One piece of advice I would definitely like to give to new investors is that you must understand clearly the difference between investing and trading, and never mix the two. Just to give an analogy, if investing is like flying at 30,000 ft, trading is like flying just above the treetops. Trading requires a lot more focus and energy as compared to investing. Also, if you are looking at wealth creation, you need to have a minimum of 5-10 years investment horizon, and either focus on quality stocks in an SIP mode, else look at investing in mutual funds or ETFs. Just remember that Rome was not built in a day, similarly, wealth creation also does not happen overnight. You need to have patience, discipline and courage to act when required.&nbsp;Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

He expects more initiatives to support Viksit Bharat's goal of fostering entrepreneurship, employment, and technological prowess. In an interview with Mint, Virk also shared his views on markets and his rate-cut outlook.Edited excerpts:What are your key expectations from the Union Budget 2024? Do you expect growth-oriented measures or populist ones?As we approach Budget 2024, we anticipate a continued focus on advancing India's digital public infrastructure, which is essential for achieving the $5 trillion economy dream.Enhanced government initiatives for financial inclusion, smart cities, AI centres of excellence and public-private partnerships in tech adoption are crucial.The fintech industry will continue to innovate with robust government support.After the Interim Budget, the outlook has been positive with initiatives like Startup India, a  ₹1 lakh crore corpus, and 50-year interest-free loans for research and innovation. This support will boost the tech sector and startup community.Reducing the fiscal deficit to 5.1 per cent of GDP by 2025-26 and investing in deep tech for defence, infrastructure, and air connectivity to tier 2 and 3 cities showcased a holistic and forward-looking approach.I look forward to more initiatives supporting developed India and Viksit Bharat, fostering entrepreneurship, employment, and technological prowess.What is your assessment of India's economic growth for the current financial year?India's FY 2024-25 economic growth looks promising, with forecasts hovering around 7.2 per cent.This optimism stems from a rebound in consumer spending, rising investments, and a strong Q3 performance.A normal monsoon and improving rural demand are expected to support growth further and stabilise inflation.The final outcome hinges on the government's ability to navigate these challenges.Sustaining positive domestic factors like rural demand and investments will be crucial.While the current outlook is positive, staying informed about yearly developments is essential, as the economic landscape can be dynamic.What is your medium-term outlook for the Indian stock market?The Indian stock market looks positive in the medium term, with some volatility.However, as a thumb rule, detailed company-level research, realistic earning goals, and investor prudence are advised as prerequisites.Large and mid-caps stocks seem less volatile from a medium-term outlook.Given the interest rate decreases, small and micro-cap stocks can also have a positive outlook.As inflation has eased a bit, interest rate cuts can be expected in the near term.Inflationary pressures have eased a bit, which may call for rate cuts in the foreseeable future.Such an action will see a spurt in demand and supply, so mid-cap and micro-cap stocks can perform well in such a scenario.If the tax rates are reduced, it can boost consumer spending and lead to business growth.Automobile and auto ancillary, defence, infrastructure, energy, capital goods, cement, railways, FMCG, and the banking and financial sectors are some of the sectors that showcase potential in the medium term.However, thorough research and detailed analysis are necessary before investing in the stock market.The market seems to have discounted most triggers. What are some key factors that will influence the market from here on?As the elections are over now, the next big thing for the market can be the Union Budget, which is expected to come in July.A favourable budget can further boost the market, which has already touched new highs since the election results were out.Investors are also looking forward to rate cuts by the central bank.As RBI started raising the interest rate following Fed rate hikes in 2022, a cut in the Fed rate can also boost the domestic market in two ways.One, foreign investors will turn towards the equity market, and India, one of the brightest spots now, will attract them further.Secondly, with rate cuts, both demand and supply can surge, boosting the business environment and the economy.Finally, the weather conditions have always played an intricate role in the Indian stock market.With favourable monsoon predictions this year, food inflation can be checked, which can be positive for the market.When can the US Fed and RBI start cutting rates? What could be the magnitude of rate reduction?Inflation has been easing over time; thus, RBI and Fed have held the rates for some time now.However, until inflation is within the determined range of the central government in both India and the US, rate cuts seem tough.If inflation continues to come down, then by the end of FY25, we can expect a cut in the interest rates, but it may not be of huge magnitude.Maybe a 25 to 50 bps cut will take the 6.50 per cent repo rate down to 6.25 per cent or 6 per cent by the end of FY25.The number of retail investors in the Indian market has sharply risen. What are the reasons behind this surge, especially in tier-2 and tier-3 regions?The Indian stock market is experiencing a surge in retail investor participation, particularly in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, driven by several factors.Increased awareness and financial literacy, propelled by the digital revolution, have made investment information and platforms more accessible through smartphones and the Internet.This accessibility, coupled with a shift in mindset away from traditional investments like gold and real estate, has fostered interest in stock market opportunities.Technological advancements such as fintech platforms offering user-friendly apps and fractional shares and the dematerialisation of shares have simplified the investment process.Economic factors also play a role, with low interest rates on traditional savings options making the stock market more attractive for higher returns and a bullish sentiment surrounding the Indian economy bolstering investor confidence.Sociological factors, including the fear of missing out (FOMO) driven by social media and aspirations for a better lifestyle among the growing middle class, further encourage participation.While this rise in retail investors is positive, it necessitates a focus on investor education and responsible investment practices to ensure that new investors understand risks and conduct thorough research before investing.How is Shoonya emerging as one of the fastest-growing brokerage platforms?Shoonya is rapidly becoming one of India's fastest-growing brokerage platforms by leveraging several key factors.In the month of May, we were 27th on the list of top brokers in India.

Former NCP leader Sachin Ahir had recently joined the Sena, which will make Thackeray’s win easy,\" a Sena source said.Ahir had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 assembly election against Sunil Shinde.Ever since the Shiv Sena was founded by late Bal Thackeray in 1966, no member of the family had contested any election or held any constitutional post.Uddhav’s cousin and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray had announced his intention to contest the 2014 state assembly elections. However, he later changed his mind.The Shiv Sena has been projecting Aaditya as the chief ministerial face if the Sena bags the highest number of seats in the next month’s Assembly polls.Uddhav Thackeray had on Saturday recalled the \"promise\" he had made to his late father Bal Thackeray to install a ’Shiv Sainik’ (party worker) as the chief minister of Maharashtra.His statement had come against the backdrop of the BJP top brass repeatedly stressing that incumbent Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis would helm the state once again.In July, Aaditya launched a state-wide ’Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ to thank the electorate for their support in the last Lok Sabha polls and to seek their backing for the upcoming Assembly elections.In the 2014 Assembly elections, the BJP and the Sena had contested separately over a dispute over sharing of seats.The BJP won maximum 122 out of 260 seats it had contested while the Sena bagged 63 out of 282 seats.After the BJP formed the government in October 2014, the Sena joined it in December the same year.

The Chang’e-6 landed in northern China’s Inner Mongolian region on June 25 in the afternoon, as per AFP.\"I now declare that the Chang’e 6 Lunar Exploration Mission achieved complete success,\" announced Zhang Kejian, Director of the China National Space Administration, during a televised news conference following the landing, the report added.Chinese scientists eagerly anticipate that these samples, including 2.5 million-year-old volcanic rock, will provide crucial insights into the geographic differences between the Moon’s two sides. The near side of the Moon, visible from Earth, contrasts sharply with the far side, which faces outer space and is characterized by mountains and impact craters rather than flat expanses.While past missions by the US and Soviet Union have collected samples from the Moon’s near side, China’s mission is the first to gather samples from the far side successfully. The achievement comes amid broader competition in space exploration, primarily with the United States, which remains the leader in the field,  ;and other nations including Japan and India. China has also established its own space station and regularly sends crews there.Chinese President Xi Jinping praised the Chang’e team, calling the mission a \"landmark achievement in our country’s efforts at becoming a space and technological power.\"The Chang’e-6 probe, launched on May 3, completed its 53-day mission by drilling into the lunar surface and collecting rock samples. \"The samples are expected to answer one of the most fundamental scientific questions in lunar science research: what geologic activity is responsible for the differences between the two sides\" explained Zongyu Yue, a geologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in a statement published in Innovation Monday, a journal associated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.In recent years, China has undertaken multiple successful lunar missions, including the Chang’e-5 mission, which collected samples from the Moon’s near side. With the successful return of Chang’e-6, scientists are hopeful that the samples will also contain material with traces of meteorite impacts from the Moon’s past.The analysis of these samples will soon begin, potentially offering new insights into the Moon’s history and the geological processes that shape planetary bodies.

The launch of the platform, which has already missed two deadlines, has now been rescheduled for June 2024.&nbsp;The regulator claims that the proposed portal will be a ‘game-changer’ and a ‘UPI moment’ for the insurance sector.&nbsp;What is Bima Sugam?Bima Sugam aims to simplify the process of purchasing insurance for consumers. &nbsp;This online platform is where customers can choose a suitable scheme from multiple options given by various companies. &nbsp;All insurance requirements, including those for life, health, and general insurance (including motor and travel) will be met by Bima Sugam.&nbsp;\"This platform will help in the settlement of claims, whether it’s health coverage or death claims, in a paperless manner on the basis of policy numbers. In short, identifying the right policy, buying it, and settling the claims and renewals will be streamlined in the online process that Bima Sugam will introduce. Insurance companies (both general and life insurers) will be major shareholders in the platform, which will offer facilities to customers via an ‘e-insurance account’ (E-IA),” said Tejinder Singh senior consultant of Alpha Capital.Benefits of the Bima Sugam portalIt will facilitate insurance companies to access the validated and authentic data from various touch points on a real-time basis. The platform will interface for the intermediaries and agents to sell policies and provide services to policyholders, among others, and reduce paperwork. Further, the paperwork involved in buying a policy will also come down. Settlement of claims and renewal of policies will also become faster as paperwork is reduced drastically, making it easier for the customers.Who benefits from the BIma Sugam portal?The scheme shall benefit consumers more than the agents, since this will affect the commissions drastically and reduce paperwork involved in processing the claims.&nbsp;“IRDAI’s robust platform will benefit insurers, hospitals, and policyholders alike. This exchange will serve as a centralized hub for health insurance-related activities; ensuring efficient policy management, quick &amp; hassle-free processing of claims, automatic fund transfer for policyholders &amp; hospitals, and reduced cost per claim to the insurer,” said Ajay Shah, Head – Distribution, Care Health Insurance.It will provide end-to-end solutions for customers’ insurance needs i.e., purchase, service, and settlement in a seamless manner. “First, you can buy policies, pay premiums, and settle all claims on a single platform. You don’t have to visit the websites of different insurers separately. Secondly, you can choose a repository to maintain all your insurance policies. If you have all the links stored in one place, claim settlement will become easier for nominees and beneficiaries,” said Tejinder SinghWith this proactive measure, IRDAI looks forward to driving positive change in the industry.

Due to the malfunction, the Boeing 737 MAX 8 rapidly descended from an altitude of over 30,000 feet to approximately 9,000 feet, as reported by Yonhap News Agency.Passenger’s ordealThe swift descent resulted in considerable discomfort and health problems for several of the 125 passengers. At least two individuals suffered from nosebleeds, and another 15 reported ear pain and hyperventilation.A passenger likened the experience of sudden altitude changes to the G-forces felt on an intense rollercoaster ride.After the aircraft landed, as many as 13 passengers were in need of medical care, although there were no reports of severe injuries.A Taiwanese woman recounted her distressing experience on social media.

The Sensex ended at 36,076.72, up 269.44 points or 0.75% while the 50-share index Nifty was at 10,859.90, up 80.10 points or 0.74%. Analysts said a rebound in global indices combined with a strengthening rupee cheered investors.According to Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd, the markets extended rally by taking positive cues from global markets. “Investors remain focused on global growth momentum while easing tensions between the US government and Federal Reserve provided an opportunity to accumulate stocks after recent consolidation. Going forward, the market will closely watch the Q3 earnings expectation, while global cues will dictate the direction,” he said. Analysts, however, added that the recent rebound shouldn’t be read as a sign of resilience as it tends to fizzle out easily with a decline in global markets. Pankaj Pandey, research head at ICICI Securities said there is a positive sentiment among investors, led by improvements in macro factors like the rupee and crude prices which had earlier crimped profit margins of corporates and dented economic growth. The markets are also expecting a cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India in its next monetary policy review in February 2019. “The sharp fall in crude oil prices, the healthy recovery in rupee/dollar and the controlled inflationary outlook may drive the RBI to closely review its monetary policy stance, which so far has been of ‘calibrated tightening’. The street is already pinning hopes on the RBI adopting a more dovish stance, and a rate cut in the monetary policy scheduled on 7 February also cannot be ruled out. This would help keep a check on any pull-back in bond yields, especially after the 10-year G-sec yield declined 94 basis points (bps) from its peak levels,” said Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd in a report 27 December. However, data released by the government on Thursday suggested the economy is at risk of missing its budget deficit target for the current fiscal year while economists said the government had already started to cut capital spending in an attempt to narrow the gap. The data showed the fiscal deficit in the April-November period stood at  ₹ 7.17 trillion ($101.93 billion), or 114.8% of the budgeted target for the fiscal year that ends in March. It is the second consecutive month that the deficit has come in above 100% of the budgeted target.Meanwhile, banking stocks rose 1.05% on reports that the government is likely to infuse  ₹ 28,615 crore into seven public sector banks (PSBs) through recapitalization bonds by the end of this month. The disbursement is expected to take place before 31 December. Out of the seven state-owned banks, Bank of India is likely to get the highest amount of  ₹ 10,086 crore, followed by Oriental Bank of Commerce, which might get  ₹ 5,500 crore through recapitalization bonds.", "Published_Date": "2018-12-28T22:49:44+05:30"},

A study by The Economist in 2019 concluded that, after adjusting for the quality of the squad, the impact of big-name coaches was small. But among the few who had a clear, positive effect was Jürgen Klopp. So the charismatic German’s announcement last week that he would leave Liverpool at the end of the season has left fans dismayed. Over nine years he has revitalised the club, delivering a first league title since 1990 and a sixth European championship. And now he has run out of energy. His final match in charge at Anfield stadium will be a highly emotional affair. How does the club go about replacing the irreplaceable?The first step is not to become overwrought. Modern football coaches are the public faces of their clubs, which makes it easy to overrate their importance. But Mr Klopp is a natural delegator. When appointed to coach Liverpool, he accepted that he would work with the chief executive, a sporting director (typically responsible for all footballing matters, from scouting youngsters to hiring coaches) and a head of player recruitment. They would have the final say on the club’s overall direction and on transfers.The previous Liverpool coach, Brendan Rodgers, bristled at this perceived lack of control. Mr Klopp welcomed it. In 2017 he asked the club to sign a German forward, Julian Brandt. The sporting director, Michael Edwards, said his analysts preferred an Egyptian winger, Mohamed Salah. Mr Klopp accepted the decision. Mr Salah has gone on to become one of Liverpool’s greatest players.Still, Mr Klopp’s longevity has made him increasingly integral to Liverpool. Mr Edwards left in 2022; his successor departed a year later. The current sporting director, Jörg Schmadtke, is a close friend of Mr Klopp and is also due to leave. Mr Klopp’s influence over transfers is believed to have grown in recent years. To give itself the best chance of continued success, the club needs to rebuild the structure—starting with the sporting director—that allowed Mr Klopp to thrive, rather than look for someone to fill the vacuum left by the exhausted incumbent.Helpfully, Liverpool only need to look 30 miles down the motorway for a lesson in what not to do. In 2013 Sir Alex Ferguson announced his retirement as Manchester United’s manager after 27 years. He became so central to the club that his power was practically unchecked. For his final two years in the job, Sir Alex could walk past a nine-foot bronze statue of himself at the club’s Old Trafford ground. He was able to handpick his successor—a fellow Glaswegian, David Moyes—and then sit in the directors’ box to watch it all fall apart.Sir Alex belonged to an era when football clubs were smaller. It was theoretically possible for one person to have the final say on everything from youth development to canteen menus. But by the time he retired United’s annual revenue was exceeding $500m. Sir Alex’s influence had stunted the growth of other senior figures. When he moved on, it became clear that United had fallen behind competitors in areas outside the first-team squad. The blame for recent failures has inevitably landed on his five successors. But this is unfair. Replacing Fergie was “somewhere in the range of impossible”, says Michael Caley, host of “Double Pivot”, a football podcast, “because you’re not really looking for one person, you really need three people”.Liverpool must identify as precisely as possible what has made Mr Klopp’s teams perform so well in order to prolong its current period of success. If the key is Mr Klopp’s playing style, roughly summarised as winning the ball back high up the pitch and launching quick counter-attacks, then Liverpool might seek a coach who has enjoyed success playing in a similar way. A good bet could be Thomas Frank, at Brentford, a Premier League club in London. He, though, has less high-level experience than Mr Klopp had when he arrived at Anfield.Alternatively, Liverpool might see Mr Klopp’s particular value as his connection with his players, the supporters and the rest of the club’s infrastructure. To imitate this, Liverpool might investigate Xabi Alonso, who is in charge of Bayer Leverkusen, the team topping the Bundesliga in Germany. Mr Alonso played for Liverpool with distinction in the 2000s and is hugely popular with the fans. Yet his Leverkusen team have a much slower, possession-heavy style, which would take time to reproduce at Liverpool with a squad designed for a different approach.The last five months of Mr Klopp’s tenure will be an anxious time for Liverpool supporters. The club could still win the Premier League and three cups. But fans will be desperate for news of his replacement. In the short term, the best news would not be the trumpeting of another well-known coach, but the swift appointment of a new sporting director. That would be a sign that Liverpool intends to retain the structure in which Mr Klopp was able to bring his particular talents to bear.© 2024, The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.

The outage impacting CDK’s dealer management system, used to complete deals, track store profitability and monitor employee compensation, has \"plunged the auto retail industry into disarray\", JPMorgan analysts said last week.

Though auto retailers have not outlined any sales hit, analysts have flagged a possible impact. \"We note some potential risk to late-June volume from the reported CDK dealer disruptions,\" Citi analysts said in a note last week.  Total new vehicle retail sales in the U.S. reached 1.1 million units in June last year, according to data from industry consultants J.D. Power and GlobalData.  Auto retailer Sonic Automotive last week said the CDK outage was likely to have a negative impact on its business operations until the systems were fully restored.

Meanwhile, corn fell on acreage expectations ahead of a USDA report on Friday and wheat was down on U.S. harvest pressure, according to analysts. CBOT most-active soybeans were up 7-1/2 cents at $11.68-3/4 a bushel at 11:07 a.m. CDT . Storms marched through the Midwest over the weekend, with localized flooding in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin threatening the soybean crop, said analysts.  \"We’ve had a lot of water in the upper Midwest and soybeans really struggle underwater, more than the corn market, more than the wheat market,\" said Don Roose, founder of U.S. Commodities.  Corn was down 6 cents at $4.29 a bushel and wheat fell 12-3/4 cents to $5.48-3/4 a bushel.  Angie Setzer, partner at Consus Ag Consulting, said corn prices fell because analysts expect an updated acreage report to show an increase in corn acres compared with data in late March.  Analysts polled by Reuters forecast 90.353 million acres of corn have been planted with corn, up from 90.036 million forecast in March.  Setzer added that funds may be punishing farmers ahead of first notice day on Friday because of \"the idea that the farmer has an extensive amount of unsold supply.\"  Wheat prices also faced pressure from the advancing U.S. harvest, said Roose. He estimated that winter wheat in the U.S. will be around 50% harvested by midweek.  Roose noted that Turkey, one of the world’s largest wheat consumers, has continued to stall imports.  Market players also awaited crop progress numbers slated to be released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture later on Monday, for an update on the impact of last week’s heat wave.

Biden takes the stage Thursday in Atlanta for a forum that materialized suddenly after uncertainty over whether he would debate his opponent at all. Republicans and conservative media have amplified video clips to raise doubts over Biden’s fitness and acuity.  The White House has labeled the videos “cheap fakes” and worked feverishly to counteract them, but their resonance underscores the stakes for Biden heading into the debate. ;  Any stumble could be politically disastrous. A strong performance could exceed expectations and dull the presumptive Republican nominee’s most potent line of attack. ;  Biden is huddling with more than a dozen aides to hone his performance, including longtime advisers Ron Klain, Bruce Reed and Mike Donilon. The sessions are set to be informal at first, with Biden and aides kicking around issues. Then they’ll start mock debates, in which Biden’s personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, will play Trump, said a person familiar with the planning, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Biden allies said the debate offers a prime opportunity to drive away age concerns, likening it to the State of the Union, for which Biden won positive reviews.  “I focus on performance and results,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, who helped Biden prepare for his 2012 vice-presidential debates by standing in for rival Paul Ryan. “Republicans have tried to use these doctored video tapes, heavily edited social media posts to mislead voters.”  Debate Strategy  The president aims to go on offense and pop voters’ rosy recollections of Trump’s presidency. Biden is preparing to attack Trump on abortion restrictions, the Jan. 6, 2021 US Capitol attack, threats to democracy and over tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, a campaign official said on condition of anonymity.  Biden’s campaign is optimistic that a national audience will be alarmed more by Trump’s words than the president’s age. At recent rallies, the former president has proposed a fighting league for migrants, called fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter a “wonderful man” and discussed at length whether it would be preferable to be eaten by a shark or electrocuted by the battery on a boat.  Biden plans on casting himself as a wise, steady leader by comparison.  “It’s reminding voters why they fired Trump in the first place,” said Jim Messina, former President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign manager. “I used to say to President Obama: Every day you’re talking about yourself and your record, you’re on the defense.”  Trump is preparing in loosely organized sessions, leading Democrats to predict he will present a more subdued version of himself.  “The media wants to lower Joe Biden’s debate performance bar so low he gets a participation trophy simply for standing upright for 90 minutes,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. Trump will press Biden on inflation, the border and immigration, he said. ;  The debate comes the same week the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether Trump is immune from prosecution for his acts as president, raising the stakes for the Republican as well.  “Trump is going to really put that more approachable, kind of sanitized version of himself forward,” said Kate Berner, a former Biden communications aide. “He knows that this is an important moment for him.”  Biden’s campaign has tempered expectations.  “Is it the be-all and the end-all of the whole thing? Of course not,” Biden campaign chair Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, who is participating in debate prep, said in a Puck podcast interview. “We have really, really big moments coming up throughout. But I think it’s as important for Donald Trump.”  Viral Videos  Critical to Biden’s effort will be avoiding a freeze or misstep opponents can exploit. ;  Conservatives gleefully circulated video from the Group of Seven summit, in which Biden stepped away from other leaders and looked toward a group of parachuters outside the camera frame during a skydiving demonstration. In other clips, Biden paused halfway while sitting during a D-Day commemoration or stood still as others danced at a Juneteenth concert. ;  White House officials angrily denounced the clips as unfair but those protests have done little to convince voters. Biden’s campaign is lining up “creator watch parties” to flood social media with clips of their own.  Biden has avoided debate flops before. In 2012, his performance against Ryan calmed Democratic nerves. And Biden benefited from his first 2020 debate with Trump, when the Republican repeatedly interrupted him. ;  Trump also attacked Biden’s son, Hunter, something the president’s aides expect again. Hunter Biden, like Trump, is a convicted felon, after being found guilty on gun charges. Some aides cited Biden’s response in 2020 that he loves his son as a highlight.  Biden is “going to try to create that split-screen and that choice for voters,” Berner said.  In one 2020 debate, Trump said “there’s nothing happening there” after Biden warned abortion rights were “on the ballot.” Two years later, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, curtailing abortion access. Biden’s campaign hammered Trump this week on the two-year mark of the decision.  Earlier: Anti-Abortion Ballot Measures Faltering Two Years After Dobbs  During the 90-minute CNN debate, moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, microphones will be muted when it’s not a candidate’s turn and pre-written notes are barred. Trump allies have criticized CNN, calling the debate a “3-on-1” event.  Trump will get the last word. After winning a coin toss, Biden’s campaign chose the podium, putting the president on viewers’ right-hand side, according to CNN. Trump’s team then settled the order of closing statements, opting to speak last.  The June timing is easily the earliest first debate in the era of televised contests. The two are scheduled to debate again on Sept. 10. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T23:15:53+05:30"},

Construction of the plant at Novo’s existing main U.S. manufacturing site in Clayton, North Carolina, will be completed between 2027 and 2029, and will add 1,000 workers to the 2,500 already employed there, the Danish company said. Novo opened the site 31 years ago.  Novo told Reuters late last year it was working to increase its in-house capacity to fill the injection pens - a process known as fill-finish - at some manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe.  Booming demand for Wegovy in the United States and the 10 other markets where it has so far been launched has propelled Novo’s shares to record highs and the company last year overtook LVMH to become Europe’s most valuable listed company.  But the success has left Novo facing shortages and forced to limit the number of patients taking the once-weekly injection.  Boosting output of Wegovy has become more urgent since rival Eli Lilly launched its own obesity drug Zepbound in the U.S. in December.  Neither company can produce enough to meet demand. Some experts predict that sales for obesity treatments could reach about $150 billion annually by the early 2030s.  Since launching Wegovy in the U.S. in mid-2021, Novo has spent billions to boost production - much of it at facilities in its native Denmark but also at other sites including the one in North Carolina.  In another attempt to grow Novo’s manufacturing capacity for Wegovy, Novo’s controlling shareholder Novo Holdings announced in February that it would buy Catalent, a large U.S.-based contract drugmaker that is a subcontractor for making Wegovy, for $16.5 billion.  Novo Holdings said that after the deal closes, it will sell three of Catalent’s fill-finish sites - in Italy, Belgium, and in the U.S. - onto Novo Nordisk.  Niels Laurbjerg Nielsen, a corporate vice president at Novo who is in charge of fill-finish manufacturing at the Clayton, North Carolina facility, said he could not comment on that deal.  In an interview with Reuters, he declined to specify how many more doses would be produced there once the new fill-finish factory opened, but said the investment was part of the company’s efforts to reach more patients.  The initial focus would be on producing Wegovy and Ozempic, although the manufacturing lines could produce other \"future\" medicines, he said, without specifying them.

Prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that the funding mechanism for their office has been upheld in past cases, as they sought to work through a thicket of legal challenges that have delayed trial indefinitely.  Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges he illegally held onto sensitive national security papers after leaving office in 2021 as well as obstructing government efforts to retrieve them. The criminal case is one of four Trump faces as he seeks to unseat Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.  Cannon, a Trump appointee, set hearings on Friday and Monday in her Florida courtroom for Trump’s lawyers to argue several motions making claims similar to those that have been rejected in other cases. On Friday, Trump attorneys urged her to find U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith has too much independence even though Trump has repeatedly blasted him as a puppet of Biden.  On Monday, Trump lawyer Emil Bove said the U.S. Justice Department should not be allowed to use a fund Congress set aside in the 1970s for independent politically sensitive investigations to pay for the documents probe.  \"More oversight from Congress is required for the extraordinary things that are going on in these prosecutions,\" Bove said. Some Republicans in the House of Representatives have called for defunding Smith’s office.  Special counsels have been appointed in Democratic- and Republican-led administrations alike to ensure an attorney can independently investigate and, if warranted, prosecute a case without any appearance of political influence.  U.S. prosecutor James Pearce told Cannon that the funding had been upheld in previous court cases that challenged other special prosecutors including David Weiss, who recently won a criminal conviction of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.  Pearce said the Justice Department would fund Smith’s office out of its regular budget if Cannon ruled that it cannot rely on the 1970s law.  Cannon has ruled in favor of the Republican presidential candidate on previous requests and has allowed a flurry of motions by his legal team to slow the case to a crawl. It is unlikely the case will reach a jury before Trump and Biden face voters in the Nov. 5 election.  GAG ORDER REQUEST  Smith’s team is due to ask Cannon later on Monday to bar Trump from making statements that pose a threat to law enforcement while he awaits trial.  Trump falsely claimed that a routine FBI use-of-force policy in effect during a 2022 search of his Florida resort authorized agents to attempt an assassination.  Prosecutors called the claim \"deceptive and inflammatory\" in a court filing and said it subjected agents to \"unjustified and unacceptable risks.\"  Trump’s lawyers say that would violate Trump’s free speech rights in the heat of the presidential campaign. They also argued that prosecutors had not presented evidence of threats against the FBI.  Cannon previously denied the request on procedural grounds after she found that prosecutors had not adequately consulted with Trump’s lawyers before filing it.  Trump faces gag orders limiting his public statements in another federal case, also overseen by Smith, accusing him of attempting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election, and a case in New York that led to his conviction in May for falsifying business records.  Trump has verbally attacked prosecutors, judges and witnesses in legal cases against him, contending that the U.S. justice system is being used to undermine his campaign.  Trump’s criticism over the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago social club intensified last month after the FBI’s use-of-force policy was made public as part of a tranche of records related to the FBI operation.  The policy stipulated that the FBI could not use lethal force unless an agent or other person was at serious risk of death or serious injury. Trump was not present at the club at the time of the search.  Trump’s baseless claim about an attempted assassination was included in campaign fundraising emails and was echoed by his allies in Congress.

The yen is faring little better against its European peer, trading just a fraction stronger than a record low of 171.56 per euro last reached in April.  At Bank of America, strategists led by Shusuke Yamada now forecast the yen weakening to 163 against the dollar by September. They see the 165 level offering a new “line in the sand” that will add pressure on Japanese authorities to prop up the currency. ;  The market remains on edge as the threat of intervention looms. At one point in London trading, the yen surged sharply, rising as much as 0.6% against the dollar before paring its advance. As of 4 p.m. in New York, the currency was some 0.1% stronger at 159.64 per dollar. ;  Brown Brothers Harriman Senior Markets Strategist Elias Haddad said the sharp move in London trading appeared “too shallow to imply BOJ stepped-in,” adding a likely intervention zone for the yen is instead around 160 to 165 per dollar. ;  The yen remains within easy striking distance of the 160.17 mark set on April 29, when Japan is thought to have waded into the market to stem losses. The vast bulk of the gains made in the yen since the suspected intervention on that day and on May 1 have now been lost despite record amounts spent by Japan. ;  Japan has acknowledged that it spent ¥9.8 trillion intervening in currency markets during the period from April 26 to May 29. Authorities haven’t specified the dates when the Bank of Japan was ordered to take action, but trading patterns indicate there were two major rounds of intervention on April 29 and May 1. Foreign reserves data indicate that Japan likely sold Treasuries to help fund that action.  “We suspect, the next round of BOJ intervention is likely to come after USD/JPY triggers buy orders perched above the late April 160.20ish high,” wrote Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia. He said the yen’s decline against the dollar last week was driven by stronger-than-expected US purchasing managers index data and the BOJ’s reluctance to provide a detailed plan around its reduction of bond purchases.  The BOJ could make more sizable cuts in bond buying after checking the view of market participants, one member of the policy board said at this month’s meeting, according to a summary of opinions issued Monday. One member said the BOJ needs to consider further adjustment of monetary easing as there are upside risks for inflation.  The pace of currency moves is also important to Japanese officials and by this measure it may not be enough to trigger immediate intervention. A gauge measuring the dollar-yen’s move from the lowest level seen in the past 28 days to Monday’s high rose to ¥6.32, which is some ¥3.7 below moves of 10-yen that Kanda has previously described as “rapid.” This suggests that speculation of an intervention may intensify when the currency pair reaches 163.  In the currency options market, the premium to hedge against a yen rise against the dollar compared with a slide in the Japanese currency declined for a fifth day, reflecting traders’ expectations that the yen still has room to weaken. ;  Currency speculators, meanwhile, continue to pile in to bearish bets against the yen. Asset managers held some 85,600 contracts tied to wagers against the Japanese currency in the week ending June 18 — the most on record in Commodity Futures Trading Commission data going back to 2006.  Global authorities are in touch with each other on a daily basis on a wide range of issues including currencies, Kanda said. The market is paying attention to currency levels, and there’s a strong sense of caution about foreign exchange intervention, the Japanese official said.  Kanda’s boss, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki, underscored Japan’s stance on the yen on Monday. The government was watching foreign exchange moves closely and would take appropriate measures against excessive currency moves if necessary, he said.  Kanda said his counterparts in Washington don’t have a problem with Japan’s intervention. “The most important thing for them is transparency,” he said. Kanda said a decision by the US to add Japan to its currency watchlist had no impact on Japan’s currency strategy.  With assistance from Naomi Tajitsu, Masaki Kondo, Michael G.

The meeting occurred after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly accused the US of withholding weapons as it pursues its Gaza campaign, which began nearly nine months ago with an assault on Israel by Hamas. ;  The White House has denied that weapons have been held back, and a State Department account of the Blinken-Gallant encounter did not mention the arms dispute.  Blinken, the department said, discussed efforts to free Israeli hostages and urged Gallant “to take additional steps to protect humanitarian workers in Gaza and deliver assistance throughout Gaza in full coordination with the United Nations.” ;  The secretary “also underscored the importance of avoiding further escalation of the conflict and reaching a diplomatic resolution that allows both Israeli and Lebanese families to return to their homes.”  Earlier: Netanyahu Sees End to Weapons Dispute as Gallant Heads to US ;  US envoy Amos Hochstein traveled to the Middle East last week in a bid to ease tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, which are threatening to spiral into a full-blown war. ;  Gallant was also expected to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.  The Biden administration has become increasingly critical of Israel’s offensive in the Gaza Strip to root out Hamas, which has been designated as a terrorist organization by the US and European Union. Some 37,000 people have been killed in the ensuing war, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants.

Moreover, they expect those roadblocks to persist whoever wins next week’s general election. ;  Both prime minister Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives and Keir Starmer’s poll-leading Labour Party have pledged to slash net migration should they win power on July 4. That stance frustrates semiconductor company bosses who already complain about Home Office hostility as they grapple with a skills shortage that can’t quickly be plugged domestically.  “Talent is the bottleneck for everything that we do,” said Rodney Pelzel, chief technology officer of IQE, which makes wafers used in chips for the wireless industry, and whose clients include Apple Inc. “Finding the skillset so far hasn’t limited us, but I could see that at a future point it would.”  With immigration looming large over the election campaign — it’s the third most important issue for voters after the economy and health care according to YouGov — politicians’ pledges to bring numbers down undermines national efforts to strengthen the domestic semiconductor industry. ;  The Tory government last year published a strategy for the sector identifying chips as “one of the five technologies of tomorrow” that’s “vital” to making Britain a technology superpower. The need for more domestic production has been brought into focus in recent years after supply chains broke down during Covid-19 lockdowns and rising geopolitical tensions highlighted the dangers of heavy reliance on overseas factories. Taiwan is the source of about 90% of the manufacturing capacity for leading-edge chips.  The government designates semiconductors a technology that’s critical to the economy due to their use in electronic devices from smartphones to cars and missiles. But some 80% of UK chip companies — valued altogether at $13 billion in 2023 according to Expert Market Research estimates — have vacancies, the UK Electronics Skills Foundation estimates.  The government’s strategy for the industry announced last year, to “improve the ability of the UK ecosystem to attract the skilled talent it needs” included just £1 billion toward boosting the industry. It’s a paltry amount compared to subsidy programs in the US and EU worth tens of billions of dollars, with the UK planning to focus on research and design rather than manufacturing.  As the global race for talented tech workers heats up, UK immigration reforms announced in December make the country a less attractive destination, compounding a shortage of tech workers that started with the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. ;  The more recent reforms included raising the minimum salaries of workers brought in on skilled worker visas, and making it harder for immigrants to bring in family members. The government also pledged to review visas for overseas graduates of UK universities. In April, electronic engineers, crucial to chip design and manufacturing, were removed from the UK’s shortage occupation list, which affords sought-after foreign professionals an easier and cheaper entry route.  “We had real difficulty in the deep tech business, real difficulty hiring people in England,” Colin Humphreys, co-founder of Paragraf, which develops chip technologies using the cutting-edge material graphene, said on a panel at the Founders Forum in Oxford this month. “We want a government which really pushes up the investment in science and technology and industry, and, also, when it makes decisions, they ask what effect will these decisions have on industry. That is not done at the moment.” ;  Humphreys said Paragraf — which has had to pay more to hire from the US and has been disappointed by the obstacles and lack of government support for its expansion — is considering moving its operations there because “of the ease of getting things done in America. It’s so difficult in England.” ;  Companies complain the visa process is too bureaucratic and takes upwards of 18 weeks, compared to six in France. Paragraf’s human resources manager, Helen Dighton, said some candidates withdraw applications when they realize the time and cost required to secure a visa, as well as the £1,035 surcharge migrants must pay to access the National Health Service. ;  “There’s just loads and loads of red tape,” said Mark Lippett, CEO of Bristol-based XMOS, which makes chips used in audio equipment. ;  Neil Dickins, founder of semiconductor recruiter IC Resources, said hiring one international employee would cost £9,000 or more in license and legal fees — which he called “a tax on companies trying to compete for global talent.” Moreover, that comes on top of the annual immigration skills charge, which depends on the company’s size but on average costs about £600, he said. A similar process would cost one tenth of the price in Germany. ;  Another chief executive officer of a British chip designer — who spoke on condition of anonymity while discussing commercial matters — described a global war for talent in which bureaucracy and prohibitively restrictive immigration rules could lead to devastating losses of potential employees to foreign competitors. ;  The executive said the Home Office had been hostile when they were trying to secure foreign recruits in the wake of Brexit, and that after moving to a new company, they’d opened a new office on the continent where it was easier to employ foreign labor. Half of the operation now runs from overseas — at a considerable loss to the UK in income tax, they noted. ;  The Home Office said its sponsorship system is designed to be easy to use and they have introduced measures to streamline processes for companies seeking to bring in skilled workers.  The problem for company bosses is that both the Tories and their likely Labour successors — Starmer’s party enjoys a polling lead over the governing one of more than 20 points, with less than two weeks to go — are talking tough on immigration. ;  Net migration to the UK fell to 685,000 last year from 764,000 a year earlier — but was still the second highest level on record. Sunak has said that if reelected he would cap migration, increase visa fees by 25% and remove student discounts on the health surcharge. Labour, for its part, pledged in its election manifesto to bring net numbers down because the UK economy “has become overly dependent on workers from abroad to fill skills shortages.”  Nevertheless, both major parties have announced skills strategies to train up Britons to tackle the shortage. Labour plans to link up skills and immigration strategy to ensure “training in England accounts for the overall needs of the labor market.” ;  A Conservative spokesperson conceded the party’s policies had made it harder for companies to bring in skilled workers. Both the Tory spokesperson and a Labour party spokesperson said that their parties would encourage businesses to resort to recruiting talent domestically. While in the longer term that may bear fruit, it doesn’t solve the present needs of industry. ;  “We don’t have time to wait for this talent to be educated,” said Chris Reichhelm, founder of executive search firm Deep Tech Leaders said. He’s advising expanding businesses to relocate, and said one high-profile client is looking to open in the US in a move reminiscent of British chip designer Arm Holdings Ltd.’s decision last year to list on the Nasdaq rather than in London. ;  “We really are shooting ourselves in the foot with this attitude to talent,” said Rupert Baines, CEO of QPT, which produces chips for more efficient electric motors. “In this industry where talent really, really matters, making things more difficult than they need to be is incredibly painful and counterproductive.”  With assistance from Jamie Nimmo and Mark Bergen.

FUNDAMENTALS  * The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade was up 0.4% at $5.73-1/2 a bushel by 0053 GMT after falling to $5.64 on Monday, the lowest since April 19.  * CBOT corn was down 0.1% at $4.33-1/4 a bushel after falling to its lowest since April 2 on Monday, while soybeans were almost unchanged at $11.30-1/4 a bushel having traded in the previous session at their lowest level since 2020.  * Argus cut its wheat production forecast for Russia, the biggest exporter, to a three-year low of 79.5 million metric tons.  * The prediction is well below estimates from leading Russian consultants Sovecon and IKAR and comes as Russian export prices continue to decline amid early harvesting data showing high yields.  * An Indian government official, meanwhile, said the country has imposed limits on wheat stocks that traders can hold and may abolish or trim the import tax on the grain, potentially increasing India’s draw on global wheat supply.  * Supply of new wheat is however maintaining pressure on prices, with the U.S. wheat harvest 40% complete, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Monday, ahead of the five-year average of 25%.  * Weather concerns hung over agricultural markets, with forecast dryness in the Black Sea region likely to stunt corn yields and heavy rain after near-record temperatures in the United States threatening to take a toll on crops.  * The condition of the U.S. corn and soybean crops deteriorated last week but ratings were still the highest for this time of the season in four years, U.S. government data showed.  * European Union crop monitoring service MARS lowered most of its yield forecasts for this year’s crops in the bloc, citing excess water in western Europe and dry weather in some southeastern countries.  * Large speculators trimmed their net short position in CBOT Trade corn futures in the week to June 18 while increasing their short positions in wheat and soybeans, regulatory data showed.  MARKETS NEWS  * Global stock indexes were mixed on Monday ahead of a key U.S. inflation reading due this week, while the dollar eased slightly against the yen from levels that put investors on alert for Japanese intervention.

The case centred around the publication of a number of classified defence documents and the exposing of government secrets by Assange and his foundation called WikiLeaks.Later this week, Assange is expected to appear in a US Federal Court in the Mariana Islands and plead guilty. As per the deal, he will plead guilty to unlawfully obtaining classified national defence information on June 26.Once done, Assange will walk free, ending the prolonged legal battle, a filing by the US Justice Department showed.Who Is Julian Assange?Julian Assange, born in Townsville, Queensland (Australia) in 1971, is the 52-year-old founder of WikiLeaks. This non-profit, whistleblowing website has been instrumental in exposing government secrets worldwide, making Assange a prominent figure in the world of information transparency.It is most notably for its explosive leak of US military files related to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.He has spent more than a decade either in custody or holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy, trying to avoid extradition — first to Sweden to answer allegations of rape, and then to the US for alleged espionage.He had a peripatetic childhood and claims to have attended 37 schools before settling in Melbourne. As a teenager, Assange discovered a talent for computer hacking, due to which he had run-ins with the Australian police. But, he admitted most of the charges levelled against him, for which he paid a fine.Assange married his wife Stella in March 2022 in Belmarsh. He is the father of two boys. He met her when she worked on his case. ;A Look At The Case TimelineAssange launched WikiLeaks in 2006 with “like-minded” IT experts and activists, AFP reported.His legal battles began in 2010 after WikiLeaks published information from classified documents about US military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rape allegations in Sweden then followed, which he denied.He was in Britain when Sweden sought his extradition. Ecuador granted him political asylum and let him into its London embassy in 2012.Assange lived in a small apartment in the embassy for seven years from 2012. He described his situation as “living in a space station”.US authorities charged him with violating the US Espionage Act in 2018.His asylum in Ecuador’s London mission ended in April 2019 after a new government in Quito handed him to British police. He has since been jailed at London’s high-security Belmarsh prison.Swedish prosecutors dropped their rape investigation in 2019. They maintained that the alleged victim’s statements were “credible”, but there was insufficient evidence to proceed.Assange has lived at Belmarsh for five years, during which time a protracted legal battle has raged to decide whether he should be extradited. ;After his June 2025 plea deal with the US, Assange was taken to Stansted airport in London and seen boarding a flight to an unnamed destination.Assange is scheduled to appear in court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a US-held Pacific island. After his release, Assange will be free to fly back to his native Australia.(With inputs from AFP)", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T07:17:58+05:30"},

She stated that Ottawa would initiate a 30-day public consultation period starting July 2 to explore how Canada should respond.\"Chinese producers are quite intentionally generating a global oversupply that undermines EV producers around the world, including here in Canada,\" Freeland told reporters in Vaughan, Ontario. Her comments reflect similar concerns raised by the US and the European Union.The public consultation aims to help the government formulate its policy response, potentially including import tariffs. Freeland emphasised that such a move would align Canada with its allies in Washington and Brussels.In May, US President Joe Biden announced significant tariff increases on various Chinese imports, including electric vehicles. The European Commission is also planning to impose additional duties of up to 38.1 per cent on Chinese manufacturers including BYD, Geely, and SAIC, as well as on Chinese-built Tesla and BMW cars, the Al Jazeera report noted.China has denied accusations of unfair subsidies and overcapacity issues, attributing the growth of its EV industry to technological, market, and supply chain advantages.An opinion piece in the Chinese state-backed Global Times urged Canada to \"remain strategically rational\" and avoid \"sacrificing normal economic exchanges with China for the sake of Washington’s strategic selfishness.\" The piece warned that Canadian tariffs on Chinese EVs \"may undermine market confidence among Chinese investors, worsen bilateral relations, and hinder normal economic and trade cooperation.\"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government has been working to position Canada as a key player in the global EV supply chain. Recently, there has been domestic pressure to take action against Chinese EVs. The Premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province and a major car manufacturing hub, called for Ottawa to impose tariffs of at least 100 per cent tariffs  ;on Chinese-made electric vehicles to protect local jobs.While Freeland did not provide specific details on potential actions or whether EV components like batteries could be targeted, she stated that \"everything was on the table.\"\"We’re not ruling anything out. We are bringing to bear our strongest trade action tools,\" she said.Canada has secured deals worth billions of dollars to attract companies across the EV supply chain, aiming to strengthen its Ontario manufacturing base, Al Jazeera reported.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T08:37:38+05:30"},

During a session of Pakistan’s national assembly, Asif expressed concern over the occurrence of targeted violence in the name of religion. ;“Every day, minorities are being killed. They are not safe under the guise of Islam. I want to address the issue of minority safety, but the opposition is blocking my efforts. Pakistan is facing global embarrassment,” the Defence Minister said, as quoted by Dawn.He claimed that religious minorities are not safe in Pakistan despite constitutional protections while calling for a resolution to safeguard marginalised communities. Asif also highlighted that many victims, with no connection to blasphemy allegations, were targeted due to personal vendettas.“Even smaller Muslim sects are not safe in Pakistan, which is a disgraceful situation. We intend to propose a resolution to protect minorities. While our constitution guarantees minority rights, there are incidents of…those who have been killed so far did not have any evidence linking them to blasphemy; rather, these killings seem to stem from personal vendettas,” the Pakistani minister said.Hindus, Sikhs, and other minorities in Pakistan persistently encounter issues like forced conversions, abductions, murders, and assaults on their religious sites, according to HRCP and Human Rights Watch reports.Additionally, the Ahmadiyya community suffers intense persecution, facing legal restrictions on their religious activities, hate speech, and violent assaults. They are consistently targeted because of their faith, with such incidents reported throughout the country, Dawn reported.Similarly, Christians also encounter discrimination in jobs, education, and blasphemy allegations, often resulting in mob violence and attacks on churches. The community remains susceptible to both societal and legal persecution. Pakistan’s legal system discriminates against religious minorities, exacerbating their marginalisation and vulnerability.The blasphemy laws are often misused to target minorities, leading to arbitrary arrests, violence, and societal ostracisation.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T08:58:01+05:30"},

Worries that trade tariffs will curtail demand for metals have dragged prices lower this year.Dollar: The dollar has weakened from its recent 18-month high against a basket of major rivals, easing pressure on metal prices.Index rebalancing: A rebalancing of asset allocations by benchmark indexes in early January will see significant buying of aluminium, zinc and Comex copper, analysts at Citi said in a note.China TC/RCs: China’s top copper smelters raised their floor treatment and refining charges for the first quarter of 2019 by 2.2%, sources said.

The court rejected Amul’s contention that its TV commercials (TVCs) did not denigrate frozen desserts.Amul owner Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF) had challenged an earlier single bench order that had ruled it guilty of disparaging frozen desserts. Consumer goods company HUL owns Kwality Wall’s brand and is the market leader in the frozen dessert category.Amul’s ice cream ad campaign, launched in March last year, emphasized the difference between ice-creams (made from milk fat) and frozen desserts (made from vegetable oil). These definitions are according to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India norms.“The appellant (GCMMF) would be free to use the said TVCs after deleting the portion which has been found to be disparaging the product frozen dessert,” said a division bench of Bombay High Court comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and Riyaz I. Chagla.The division bench had passed an order on 13 December that was uploaded on the Bombay high court website on 26 December. Amul’s ads urged customers to choose ice-creams over frozen desserts, claiming that the latter was made with vanaspati. Soon after the launch of the campaign, HUL filed a lawsuit in Bombay high court asking for Amul to be stopped from airing the ads and seeking damages. HUL argued that as Kwality Wall’s was the largest frozen dessert brand in India, it was directly hit by Amul’s ads though the commercials did not refer to it by name.In June 2017, a single-judge bench of Justice S.J. Kathawalla granted HUL’s plea for an injunction against the advertisements. Amul challenged the order in the division bench. The division bench took the view that the single bench order was a blanket injunction that could not have been granted and held that the TVCs in their entirety could not be said to be objectionable. The bench held that GCMMF was free to use the first seven out of a total of 10 snapshots in each of the two TVCs.Vishal Maheshwari, co-founder of V.M. Legal Advocates, who is representing Amul in the case, confirmed the development but refused to divulge details citing confidentiality. HUL declined to comment on the developments. “India is not just one country, but a lesson in diversity. While urban India is now grappling with pollution and infrastructure issues, and hence failing healths, they are much more concerned about the food and ingredients that go into making it,” said Tina Jain Mehta, founder of Mumbai-based boutique branding agency Pineapple Consulting. “In sharp contrast, Bharat is in a state of euphoria as more brands/choices are available to them and they are in a mood to experiment", "Published_Date": "2018-12-28T18:01:22+05:30"},

Sebi and rating agency valuation term anything below ‘BBB’ as below investment grade. A side pocket ensures money invested in a mutual fund liquid scheme that is linked to stressed assets gets locked until the fund recovers the cash from the company. Investors can redeem the rest of their money. However, Sebi has left it to the discretion of the fund manager whether to use the facility or not. “The Sebi circular is a clarification to about what is a credit event on which a fund manager can use a side pocket,” said Kaustubh Belapurkar, director of fund research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India Pvt. Ltd.“I do not envisage a scenario where segregating of these assets will become common. Even today fund managers can take riskier bets but they have largely subscribed to high rated papers. This will be used only in scenarios where there is an actual credit event and investors and fund manager are saddled with bad assets,” said Belaprukar. The regulator has proposed a disincentivising mechanism to further prevent misuse such as taking riskier bets. “Trustees shall ensure to have a mechanism in place to negatively impact the performance incentives of fund managers, chief investment officers (CIOs) involved in the investment process of securities under the segregated portfolio,” said Sebi.This disincentivisation would mirror the existing mechanism for performance incentives of the fund house. The segregation of assets will need to be approved by the trustee board. All further subscription and redemption will be barred in the scheme, to also ensure that no one set of investor ends taking advantage till the approval. All existing investors in the scheme as on the day of the credit event will be allotted an equal number of units in the segregated portfolio as held in the main portfolio. No subscription and redemption will be allowed in the segregated portfolio, but unit holders will be given an exit opportunity. “In order to facilitate exit to unit holders in segregated portfolio, AMC (asset management companies) shall enable listing of units of segregated portfolio on the recognized stock exchange within 10 working days of creation of segregated portfolio,” said Sebi. AMCs will also not be allowed to charge investment and advisory fee on the segregated portfolio. ", "Published_Date": "2018-12-28T23:49:59+05:30"},

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, criticized for months by lawmakers, privacy advocates and some investors, said he was “proud of the progress we’ve made,” fighting misinformation and protecting users’ personal data during one of the company’s most tumultuous years.“To be clear, addressing these issues is more than a one-year challenge,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. “For some of these issues, like election interference or harmful speech, the problems can never fully be solved.”This year was one of constant apologies for the social network, after multiple instances of broken trust with its users. Zuckerberg testified for the first time in front of Congress in April, explaining why Facebook allowed users’ data to fall into the hands of unauthorized third parties. In his reflection on Friday, he made the case that Facebook is now a changed company, and will be more proactive about problems.“We’ve fundamentally altered our DNA to focus more on preventing harm in all our services,” he wrote.The blows to Facebook’s reputation also have hurt the stock, which declined 24% this year through Thursday’s close, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped 6.9%. The shares fell about 1% to $133.28 at 1:32 pm on Friday in New York.In Zuckerberg’s list of things Facebook accomplished in 2018, some remain undone, or already widely critiqued. For example, he writes that Facebook automatically takes down 99% of terrorist content before anyone reports it, without saying that the statistic only refers to content from the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. He also points to a “clear history” tool the company started building.

How the rupee rate will impact your travel expenses | Mint", "Author": "Vivina Vishwanathan", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/vivina-vishwanathan", "Content": "Mumbai: The rupee movement can change you travel route. 2018 was not a great year for those who chose to travel overseas for leisure and education. But the rupee fall is likely to continue in 2019 as well, according to experts. “We witnessed massive depreciation of rupee during the mid-year. The rupee moved from 63 to 74 per dollar, the biggest move in rupee since 2013. Part of this is because of stronger global crude oil prices and we saw the reflection on India’s current account deficit which stood at 2.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in June quarter and 2.8% in September quarter. The bigger reason for depreciation of rupee was on the capital account side. While the year 2013 was completely current account problem, in 2018 we saw stress both on current account side as well as on the capital account side,” said Sujan Hajra, chief economist from Anand Rathi Financial Services.“Global liquidity condition has already changed from accommodative to neutral. The next year, it will remain neutral and not tight,” said Hajra.“At least for the first half of the year, we see the dollar remaining strong, means we expect rupee to depreciate— anywhere between 3% and 6%—in 2019,” he added. Considering the rupee condition, here is a look at how you can plan your holiday in 2019:Drop the trip durationThe depreciating rupee has affected international travellers but people continue to travel.“People will still travel even if rupee swings by 3-6%. The number of days for the trip may come down. For Europe, typically you will spend 15 days at least. But if the rupee depreciates by 8-10%, then the duration will come down to 7-10 days. Travellers will reduce the duration but they wouldn’t stop going to places like Europe,” said Anand Menon, vice president and head—travel tours, leisure travel, FCM Travel Solutions.The total expenditure of the trip continues to remain same.“Say if someone plans to spend  ₹ 5-6 lakh on a holiday. The amount will be constant but the duration reduces,” Menon added.He further said that in terms of destinations, Vietnam, Cambodia, Jordan and East Europe are picking up pace.Book at least 2 months in advanceOne of the major costs of international travel is the cost of your flight tickets. Menon said that Indians have started booking tickets at least 45 days in advance.According to Kayak, the best time to book tickets is on Wednesday at 8.30am to get a good deal.If you are planning to travel overseas, the best time to book your tickets is two months in advance before the travel date.By booking in advance, you can save 11-33% of your travel cost. The major international destinations that travellers are planning to opt for include Phuket, Istanbul and Moscow.It is difficult to predict how the rupee will move. Hence, it is better to plan in advance all your trips.You will get a better deal not just on flight but on accommodations as well. If you are planning to travel overseas next year, make it a point to save money for your travel plans.Avoid taking loans for holidays. Taking a loan can make your trip expensive. Instead start saving and put your money either in liquid funds or fixed deposits depending on the income.", "Published_Date": "2018-12-29T10:35:10+05:30"},

Indian stock markets ended higher on Friday, helped by strong gains in banking stocks as sentiment was boosted by extended gains on Wall Street. For the week, the Sensex rose 0.94% and the Nifty 50 added 0.98%. So far this year, the NSE Nifty has gained 3.13%, while the Sensex has risen 5.93%. Both indexes are on track for a fourth yearly gain in five. Here are the top 10 stock ideas for 2019 from Motilal Oswal:Titan: Target price -  ₹ 1,105“Wedding season demand is scaling up well for Titan. In our view, if consumers continue flocking to its stores in the wedding season, Jewellery sales growth of 25% for the full year is achievable.” The brokerage expects 25% EPS CAGR over FY18-20.Indian Hotels: Target price -Rs 163“Indian hospitality industry is set to enter into an upcycle, led by favourable demand-supply dynamics. Given its presence in high-demand, high-occupancy micro markets, Indian Hotels is strategically well placed to capitalize on the growth opportunities.” “Indian Hotels also has an edge in terms of operating leverage, given its high fixed-cost proportion and efforts to rationalize expenses.”Marico: Target price -  ₹ 465“There has been an evident step-up in the pace of new launches over the past 18 months with couple of notable successes. The recent pipeline and successes so far could enable a new era of growth for Marico if all goes according to plan.”“Strong performance of Parachute volumes continues in recent quarters along with healthy growth prospects in the VAHO (Value added hair oil) segment.”Oberoi Realty: Target price -  ₹ 574“Oberoi has one of the strongest balance sheets among real estate companies, with negligible net debt. With strong monetization visibility from its ongoing and upcoming projects, Oberoi is expected generate healthy free cash flow over FY18-20. We believe such financial strength offers the company with an opportunity for value-accretive land acquisitions to drive growth potential beyond the existing land bank.”ICICI Bank: Target price -  ₹ 400“ICICI is in the midst of an improvement in the operating environment (stressed asset resolution and growth pick-up) and is showing healthy signs of earnings normalization. We expect earnings momentum to accelerate from FY20 as the asset quality cycle peaks out, domestic business growth remains strong and the rising mix of retail adds more granularity to loan book.”“Further, we expect ICICI Bank to gain from the current crisis in NBFC space, due to its strong franchise in deposits along with superior customer reach across business segments”Aurobindo Pharma: Target price -  ₹ 920“We remain positive on Aurobindo on robust ANDA filings rate, strong pace of approvals, minimal regulatory hurdles and the company outperforming the industry in the EU market.”Hindustan Unilever: Target price -  ₹ 2,140“Four key trends are helping HUL in elevating its earnings growth trajectory to ~20%: (1) rapidly improving adaptability to market requirements, (2) recognition and strong execution on Naturals, (3) strong trend toward premiumization and (4) extensive plans to employ technology and create further entry barriers.”“The acquisition of GSK Consumer healthcare business pushes HUL among the market leaders in the only key category where it did not have market leadership (Food and Refreshments).”Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Ltd“The light electricals industry is poised for robust double-digit growth over the coming few years largely driven by growth in LED. Crompton has undertaken multiple cost rationalization initiatives to combat the margin pressure in the lighting segment. We like Crompton for its strong product portfolio, established brand, market leadership, wide distribution network, and robust RoE/RoCE profile.”Infosys Ltd: Target Price –  ₹ 800“Growth for Indian IT should gradually pick-up from current 6-7% as Digital services proliferate which is still small. Infosys has built capabilities to match spend shifts in the past three years and Digital revenue now accounts for ~30% of company’s revenue.”“The acceleration in growth momentum, aided by a pick-up in verticals like Financial Services and Retail, and the visibility for its continual from recent deal wins provides confidence of improvement in the coming quarters.”Larsen and Toubro: Target price –  ₹ 1,570“Key positive triggers for L&amp;T are 1) Pick-up in private capex cycle supported by government capex, 2) Timely execution of strong order backlog, 3) Divestment of the non-core assets and net working capital cycle improvement.”“Divestment of the non-core assets (like L&amp;T cutting tools, EWAC alloys etc.) and net working capital cycle improvement is in line with Project Lakshya. In Q1FY19, L&amp;T signed agreement with Schneider Electric for sale of its Electrical &amp; Automation segment for a cash consideration of INR112b (post tax).”Disclaimer: Livemint.com advises readers to check with experts before taking any investment decisions.", "Published_Date": "2018-12-29T10:37:00+05:30"},

Traders weigh in on stock tumult | Mint", "Author": "Bloomberg", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/bloomberg", "Content": " Seeing prices run away is part of doing business in smaller stocks. Seeing it happen when he was trying to fill an order in blue chips recently was something unusual for Beltran de la Lastra.“If you go into the large caps and you try to do a significant trade -– let’s say in a big fund company of $200 billion you’re trying to do a $50 million clip, a $100 million clip -– you should be able to do it fairly quickly,” said de la Lastra, chief investment officer at Spanish asset manager Bestinver Gestion. “The reality is that you may have to be working on it for a few days.”As a decade-long equity bull run starts to waver, liquidity risk -- the possibility markets will struggle to absorb selling demand without large price moves -- has been mentioned by everyone from Goldman Sachs to Donald Trump. Worries like that aren’t new and predictably increase when markets are in free fall, as they have been recently. But rarely have they gotten a bigger test than in the last few weeks.Few topics on Wall Street get blood boiling faster than liquidity, particularly when worries about exchange structure are dragged in, as they are by critics who decry the supplanting of human market makers by machines. Those arguments may never be convincingly decided. But a few traders were willing to discuss what they saw over the last few weeks amid some of the toughest markets in a decade.The depth of the S&amp;P 500 futures market has thinned by 70 percent over the past year to a new decade low, Goldman Sachs strategists led by John Marshall wrote in a note on Dec. 18. Single stock liquidity has fallen 42 percent over the past year to some of the lowest levels since the crisis, the bank said, citing a proprietary model.The problem isn’t structural or related to high-frequency traders or passive products, Goldman contended. Simple risk aversion among professional investors is the more likely driver of reduced liquidity, rather than the growth in electronic trading, according to its strategists.Evidence of risk aversion is everywhere, of course. More than $5 trillion has been erased from US stock values in the last three months as the S&amp;P 500 slid within points of a bear market. At the same time, share totals on US exchanges have regularly exceeded 9 billion in the last few weeks, a fact mentioned by skeptics who say it’s to tough frame that much volume as a bust in liquidity.Just because Goldman Sachs chalks it up to more sellers than buyers, it doesn’t mean everyone else does. Several investors spoken to for this article expressed concern that structural changes since the crisis have made the market more vulnerable.Squishy PricesParticularly in Europe, concern was voiced that spreads proved a bit less sturdy than versus recent history. Again -- perfectly ordinary, when markets go south. But a contingent of analysts and investors say that even given the relentless selling that has plagued markets since October, it doesn’t totally explain the squishiness of prices over the last few months.A common theory of these investors is that passive funds sap liquidity when pressed into harmonized action and that their selling overwhelms high-frequency market makers -- a theory that academic research is skeptical of. Other critics cite post-crisis regulations that made it costlier for banks to hold positions.“If you don’t play the market by trying to value one stock versus the other and those kinds of things, but by being in and out of the market, the minute you have a shift in the sentiment then it can reduce significantly the liquidity in the market,” said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Prime Partners SA in Geneva.Spreads have widened because of the market’s changing structure, according to Aram Green, fund manager at ClearBridge Investments in New York, though he doesn’t agree that liquidity has worsened.“You’ll see a price on your screen of a stock down 30 dollars and you go to buy it and there’s no volume to buy it. And next thing you know it’s back to flat,” he said. At the same time, “we decide that we’re going to get out of half a million shares, and the thing only trades 300,000 shares a day and we put it out there in some dark pool, and it’s gone in 30 seconds. So you don’t know until you test it.”", "Published_Date": "2018-12-29T18:13:21+05:30"},

Hedge funds. Trillion-dollar price tags on Apple and Amazon. Trading records everywhere. Not even Christmas was spared the wrath of cascading stocks. It feels unprecedented, Armageddon, or maybe the robot apocalypse. It isn’t. While any 20 percent sell-off hurts, the one happening now is far from unprecedented in terms of depth or velocity. Over the past 100 years, there are almost too many examples to count of stocks tumbling with comparable force.“It’s an inevitable process,” Marshall Front, founder of Front Barnett Advisers, who began on Wall Street in 1963. “It goes on over and over again.”Investors have time to reflect on history, now that stocks have avoided a fourth straight down week via the biggest one-day rally since 2009. After coming within a few points of a bear market on Wednesday, the damage in the S&amp;P 500 stands at 15 percent since Sept. 20.“This is very normal. It unnerves people because we’re all talking about it all the time,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management. “It’s in our face more. We have too much focus on the day-to-day or minute-by-minute or second-by-second movements. Historically, is this normal? Yes.”A fair amount of complaining has gone on in recent months about the role of high-frequency traders and quantitative funds in the drubbing that reached its peak around Christmas. Perhaps. Those groups are big, and in the search for villains, they make an easy targets. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is among the people who have made the inference.One thing that makes it tough to lay blame for the meltdown on machine-based traders is the frequency with which the markets plummeted long before they existed. The Crash of 1929 stands as one big example. However bad this market is, it’s a walk in the park compared with then.“The largest percentage changes, except for 1987, were in the ’20s and ’30s,” said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp. “You had dramatic moves then and you didn’t have electronic trading then.”Dotcom BustThe dot-com bubble that had been developing since the late 1990s popped in March 2000, when the S&amp;P 500 lost 35 percent over the course of two months. It took the Nasdaq Composite Index, which peaked at 5,040.62 on March 10, 15 years to get to its old high.Black Monday of 1987The S&amp;P 500 rose 36 percent between January and August 1987 in what was set to be the best year in almost three decades. Then the October sell-off pushed the S&amp;P into a 31 percent correction in a matter of 15 days, much of it occurring on that infamous day.1974 Sell-OffThe worst year since 1937 for the S&amp;P 500 saw the index fall 33 percent in 115 days as a weakening economy, rising unemployment and spiking inflation pushed investors to head for the exits. Stocks subsequently rebounded, surging more than 50 percent between October 1974 and July 1975.1962 RoutInvestors of a certain age may recall 1962, when the S&amp;P 500 Index lost a quarter of its value between March and June 1962. The rout known as the Kennedy Slide came after the S&amp;P 500 advanced 79 percent in the prior four years. The S&amp;P 500 was essentially flat over the next two decades.Not So Fat ’57A dive in car sales and slowing housing construction pushed stocks into a 20 percent correction in a matter of 99 days in 1957. This preceded a recession that saw the US gross domestic product contract 10 percent in a matter of three months in 1958.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Flipkart and US-based Amazon -- the two largest players in the burgeoning Indian e-commerce sector -- are expected to be hit the hardest once the new norms come into effect from February 2019.“The new e-commerce restrictions announced by the government of India on December 26 are a cause for concern. While we are still trying to understand the full implications, we fear that these restrictions will have a far-reaching negative impact both on US investments and on Indian consumers,” said Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Chambers of Commerce (USAIC), a wing of the US Chambers of Commerce.The former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia said the US-India Business Council (USIBC) said that a February 1 deadline is too rushed and does not allow sufficient time for companies to analyse the policy and to comply.“We urge the government to delay implementation and allow time for comment before the policy goes into effect,” Biswal said.Mukesh Aghi, president of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) said “this is not in the best interest of the Indian consumers”. “Coming out with such a major policy change overnight without any consultative process eats into the predictability” and reliability factor that all US companies are looking into India for any foreign direct investment,” he said.“I wish there was a little more consultative process, because you have companies like Walmart, which has put in $16 billion and they are in the process of putting more money to streamline their investment, it makes our job more difficult because how do I go and tell them please invest more and the policy would not change overnight,” said Aghi, who has been working with US companies to make large scale investment in India. “I at the moment embarked on a campaign convincing US company manufacturing in China to move it to India. How do I tell them, hey policies overnight would not change,” he said, adding that with such policy pronouncements, India can’t have a “transparent, predictable environment” which is a must for any foreign company to invest.Referring to Union Commerce and Industries Minister Suresh Prabhu’s remarks that he wants to focus on bringing $100 billion FDI to India, Aghi said the first thing is to have a predictability in a regulatory environment. “This process sends the opposite message,” he said.

Almost all emerging Asian currencies are expected to weaken by the end of June, while bond yields are forecast to rise for countries including Indonesia, India and Thailand, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.“EM Asia is one in which we believe there is still pressure for yields to move higher and curves to steepen, based on our view of the US Treasury curve,” said Roland Mieth, emerging-markets portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Singapore. “The overall outlook for EM Asia government bonds remains cautious.”Reports due this week on Chinese manufacturing PMI, South Korean exports and Singapore gross domestic product may provide further evidence the region’s economy is losing momentum.The Bloomberg JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index has fallen almost 5 percent this year, set for the biggest annual decline since 2015. A Bloomberg Barclays index of emerging Asian government debt is heading for its first annual loss in three years.While the US and China are scheduled to meet in the second week of January for trade talks, Citigroup Inc. says even if the dispute is resolved, the damage can’t be immediately reversed. Asia’s biggest economy is already feeling the chill: retail sales are cooling and industrial profits are down, prompting policy makers to pledge more stimulus.Positive signsThere are at least some reasons to be hopeful for emerging Asian assets: oil prices have dropped about 40 percent from their October peak, which is a boon for countries that import the commodity. Central banks remain vigilant, while a growing number of analysts, including those at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS Group AG, say the dollar is close to its peak.Meanwhile, positions betting the dollar will strengthen are near the highest in almost two years, which to some traders suggests the currency is set to decline.“We see less headwinds for Asian local markets from the US dollar as we transition into the new year, but slowing global growth and continued trade frictions will contribute to a challenging macro backdrop,” said Stuart Ritson, portfolio manager for emerging market debt at Aviva Investors in Singapore.“The key factors that will be important in 2019 are the extent of the slowdown in China and the ability of the authorities to keep the CNY stable as well as the ongoing trade frictions with the US,” he said.Emerging markets as a whole may also be due a breather in 2019, according to a Bloomberg survey of 30 investors, traders and strategists. Stocks, currencies and bonds of developing economies have found a floor and will probably outperform their developed-nation counterparts next year, the survey found.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.", "Published_Date": "2018-12-30T09:27:30+05:30"},

With the proposed strategic stake sale of the Air India failing to take off in May this year, the government has been working on various initiatives, including hiving off a significant chunk of over  ₹ 55,000 crore debt into a special purpose vehicle, to turn-around the ailing airline.Against this backdrop, the government is now actively considering the proposal to professionalise Air India management.Talking about steps for reviving the national airline, Prabhu said there are plans for complete professionalisation.“I have already ordered a global search for professionalisaton of Air India completely. All top positions in Air India should be filled by some sort of a global search. That proposal is now under active consideration of the government,” the minister told PTI in an interview.A source in the know said the government plans to set up a search committee that would look for aviation professionals from across the world who can brought to Air India.Currently, the national carrier -- which is staying afloat on taxpayers’ money -- has nine members on the board, including two officials from the civil aviation ministry.The chairman and managing director is senior IAS officer Pradeep Singh Kharola while two well known businessmen -- ITC chairman Y C Deveshwar and Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla -- are independent directors on the board.Ravinder Kumar Tyagi, Syed Zafar Islam, Daggubati Purandeswari are the other independent directors.Air India Director (Finance) Vinod Hejmadi as well as Civil Aviation Ministry’s Additional Secretary Gargi Kaul and Joint Secretary Satyendra Kumar Mishra are also part of the board.Prabhu said debt is one of the biggest problems for revival of Air India, adding that the civil aviation ministry is already working with the finance ministry to address the issue.The carrier is estimated to have a debt burden of over  ₹ 55,000 crore and about  ₹ 29,000 crore is to be transferred into an special purpose vehicle.On December 27, the Civil Aviation Ministry told the Lok Sabha that the government has prepared a revival plan for Air India.A comprehensive financial package, including transfer of non-core debt and assets to a special purpose vehicle, implementation of robust organisational and governance reforms by the board and differentiated business strategies for each of the core businesses of Air India are part of the plan.“Higher levels of operational efficiency by strengthening management and implementing best business processes” are among the major elements of the plan.

The quartet consisting of Muhammed Anas, Amoj Jacob, Muhammed Ajmal Variyathodi and Rajesh Ramesh etched their names in the annals of Indian sports history.During the high-stakes event on August 26, the unheralded Indian relay team not only smashed the Asian record but also created history by becoming the first Indian contingent to secure a spot in a World Championship final.The heat they competed in featured formidable opponents, including the American team. However, instead of succumbing to pressure, the Indian athletes exhibited remarkable determination, delivering a performance that left both commentators and spectators awestruck.Among these athletes, Rajesh Ramesh has a journey marked by resilience. Despite an early start in the field and even participating in the 2018 U20 World Championships, his career experienced setbacks due to injuries, work commitments, and the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Watch: Neeraj Chopra calls Arshad Nadeem to pose with the Indian tricolour, Pakistani athlete does THISJust a couple of years ago, the notion of participating at this level of competition seemed distant for Ramesh.

As the 37-year-old begins his 20th year on the tennis tour—itself an achievement, given how many of those years he has spent at the top and being the hunted—it’s a number waiting to be rounded. Then, there’s Jimmy Connors.With 109 titles, Connors holds the record in the Open Era—beginning 1968, when the artificial wall dividing professionals and amateurs came down—for the maximum number of singles titles. He’s held it since 1989, when he won the last of his tournaments, ironically at the same age as Federer is now.In an interview last year to The New York Times, Federer said that breaking Connors’s record of 109 titles was not his “ultimate goal”. If it really was, he added, he would skip more top-tier events, which have tougher draws, and play more second- and third-rung tournaments. This distinction that Federer makes is a point of distinction between the bucketful of titles of Federer and Connors.In top-flight men’s tennis, there are three rungs of tournaments. At the first level, there are principally the four grand slams and the nine masters events, which top players are rarely selective about. Below this comes the ATP 500 and ATP 250 events, where the fields are relatively weaker.As many as 53 of Federer’s 99 titles have come in the top-tier tournaments. His other two illustrious contemporaries, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, are better on this count. While they are on 80 and 72 total titles, respectively, both have a return of 51 titles from top-tier events.This is a point of contrast with Connors, only 28 of whose titles came from the big events.It’s partly a construct of the tennis tour being more fragmented in the 1970s and 1980s, when Connors played. For example, leading European players did not cross over to the US regularly and instead played similar lower-level events in Europe. Of his 109 titles, the American with the fiery temper and a fierce game won 75 of his 109 titles in the US.While a rider on the tiered nature of tournaments might be in place, no such thing can be said about Connors’s longevity. Or that of Federer’s. Both players won their first title at the age of 20 years, and both have 18 years separating their first title and their last/latest title.However, there are differences. By the young standards of tennis, Federer was a relatively late bloomer. He turned professional in 1998, at the age of 17 years. However, he won his first tournament in 2001.Among the set of top three title winners and his two chasing contemporaries, Federer had the slowest start on the title count. Till the age of 22 years, he trailed all of them in titles, with 11 titles, against 32 for Connors and 31 for Nadal. However, once he found his groove and a touch of invincibility, Federer went on a run, accumulating 42 titles between the age of 23 and 26.What’s more remarkable is what Federer has done in his 30s. In his 30s, Connors became recognized more for scripting stirring comebacks in grand slam five-setters, but not so much for titles. He won 13 titles in the nine years he played into his thirties. Federer, by comparison, has won 29 titles in his 30s (chart 2).While Federer has run through a significant part of the arc of his 30s, Nadal and Djokovic are just about beginning that stretch where the tendency of the body is to disregard the mind and the heart. Ask Andy Murray, who is still appended to this troika but who announced this week that this will be his last year because of a hip ravaged by the years. If he does retire, he would do so at the age of 31 with 45 titles. In their own ways, Nadal and Djokovic are also feeling the physical strain of playing top-flight tennis, which only amplifies what Federer is doing today.Each player in our set of five shows a preference for certain surfaces. Of these five, Federer’s title portfolio is the most diversified across three surfaces. In other words, he does the best job of maximizing his strengths (grass and hard courts), while squeezing out something from his least-favoured surface (clay).Playing on a limited schedule, Federer won four tournaments last year and also briefly held the top ranking. He won tournament number 99 in October 2018. Number 100 could be a matter of time and it would still just be a statistic.howindialives.com is a database and search engine for public data", "Published_Date": "2019-01-18T08:47:08+05:30"},

The match was dominated by the bowling sides of both teams and batters couldn't display much of their skills today.CSK had a slow start and lost early wickets, but Shivam Dube and MS Dhoni smashed some big shots to take the score to 167. In response, DC struggled from the first ball and the wickets kept falling. The team could only manage 140 runs and lost the game by 27 runs.CSK innings:CSK started slow with Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad playing cautiously taking their time. Axar Patel bowled beautifully during the fifth over and Devon Conway was gone. Soon, Axar Patel again struck and the other opener Ruturaj Gaikwad followed his partner to the pavilion.Moeen Ali came with a mindset of stabilizing the innings and tried a partnership with Ajinkya Rahane, but Kuldeep Yadav didn't like the idea and dismissed Ali for 7. After 10 overs the CSK innings was at 66/3, their lowest at this stage in the season.Shivam Dube played some explosive shots and eased off some pressure with back-to-back boundaries, but Mitchell Marsh enticed the young batter, and skipper David Warner grabbed his catch. Ambati Rayudu and Ravindra Jadeja played some safe shots and slowly picked up the speed of the innings.Khaleel Ahmad took out Ambati Rayudu, but no CSK fan was sad as this meant the legend MS Dhoni will walk on crease now. MS Dhoni played a small innings of 9 balls but smashed 20 runs with the help of two sixes and one four.At the end of the first innings, CSK was at 167/8.DC innings:&nbsp;Chasing 167, DC had a shaky start with Deepak Chehar dismissing skipper David Warner on the second ball of the innings. Phil Salt played some big shots during the second and third over until Deepk Chehar also sent him back to the pavilion, DC was two down for just 20 runs.Soon, a running mix-up ended in Mitchell March getting dismissed for a silly runout, the DC was in real trouble now.Manish Pandey and Rilee Rossouw played cautiously in partnership with occasional boundaries and somehow the scoreboard started to move. But CSK bowlers were bowling with a clear objective to take away wickets, and soon Pandey's patience gave up and ‘impact player’ Matheesha Pathirana took out the player. After 13 overs DC was at 84/4.One brings two is a common phrase used in cricket and Ravindra Jadeja proved that by dismissing Rossouw soon after Pandey. Axar Patel came and attempted some boundaries, but the exercise was looking futile as the match was slipping away from DC's hand. At the end of the second innings DC's score was 140/8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2023-05-10T21:21:47+05:30"},

With records breaking high scores and runs flowing like river water from mountains, bowlers are having a very hard time.Looking at some data, in just 35 matches so far in IPL 2024, there have been 15 instances that 200-runs mark been breached and 5 times 250-runs mark been breached.Among the teams scoring 250-plus runs in IPL 2024 is Sunrisers, which did it for three times, even making the highest of 287 in IPL history.ALSO READ: Watch: As Rishabh Pant looks disheartened after loss, Sunil Gavaskar tells him, ‘I don't ever want to see you down’Earlier on 20 April, while playing against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium scored 266/7 in 20 overs, out of which 125 runs were scored in the powerplay itself -- which is also a record. Travis Head even scored his quickest half century in just 16 deliveries and hit 89 off just 32 balls.Meanwhile, with scenarios going against bowlers, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar suggested BCCI to protect bowlers.According to him, the boundary ropes can be pushed a little more back, especially at smaller venues, pointing at the gap between the fence and the advertisement board where where the stands begin.“I wouldn't suggest any changes to a cricket bat because they are all within regulations, but I have been saying this for a long time, increase the size of the boundary at every ground. Look at this ground today, there is enough space to take it back a little more by a couple of metres. It can often prove to be the difference between a catch and a sixer. You can push that LED or advertisement boards even further so that the boundary rope can go back by 2-3 metres and that will make a difference. Otherwise, the bowlers are the only ones who will suffer,” HT quoted Gavaskar as saying while speaking to fellow India legend Anjum Chopra.He was of the opinion that the power-hitting in T20 cricket may get boring eventually, citing lack of contest between batters and bowlers.“What we have been seeing in T20 cricket over the last few days is that this is batting like the coach tells in the nets, 'This is the last round,' and everybody starts swinging their bat around bang, bang whether they get out or not. It's enjoyable to a little extent, but after that it gets...not so exciting. I wanted to use a stronger word, but no,” he added.", "Published_Date": "2024-04-21T14:59:56+05:30"},

With an investment of about $10 million over the next 3-5 years, the league is expected to debut by late 2024, or early 2025.Gaurav Natekar, former tennis ace and owner of NSG, said the investment will not only help launch the league in India, but also fuel growth of pickleball across Asia.&nbsp;The collaboration seeks to nurture the sport's development from its grassroots to professional levels, he said in an interview with Mint.Pickleball, which dates back to the US of 1960s, is a racquet sport, comprising elements of tennis, badminton, and table tennis, and takes up only a quarter of the space of a tennis court. It has gained traction recently in the world sporting arena.Also Read: Step Aside Pickleball, America's New Local Battle Is Over CricketIn February, SETVI and NSG inked a 10-year licensing agreement with the All India Pickleball Association (AIPA), which is affiliated with the International Pickleball Federation (IPF). Natekar will have a majority stake in the league, with SETVI coming in as the \"first investor\".Sony-owned SETVI is an entertainment company, specializing in media ventures, besides offering technical support and strategic investments to promote sporting events.“We are committed to supporting innovative sports ventures. Our partnership marks a step toward creating new opportunities in the industry. We will fuel the growth of this sport and extend its reach among audiences,” said Nachiket Pantvaidya, chief executive, SETVI.SETVI is not the first sports channel to set up a sporting league as a partner. In 2014, Star India had acquired a 74% stake in Mashal Sports, which established the Pro Kabaddi League. Star had also partnered with IMG Reliance to launch the Indian Super League football event.Pickleball could potentially reach 30 million middle- and upper-middle-class Indian households, Natekar said. \"There are quite a lot of tennis, badminton and table tennis players already playing this sport around the world. It is pretty easy to learn. It is age- and gender-agnostic, and is a \"new-age\" sport, Thus, it should make it more relevant to those watching it,\"&nbsp;Also Read: After spurning Zee, Sony sets sight on aha\"Sports like these don't require large investments to hit the ground running on television.\" The league will be streamed live on television to develop the sport further, Natekar added.&nbsp;League to involve 6 teams and adopt city-based model seen in similar sporting eventsThe league will involve six teams, each comprising five to eight players, and adopt the city-based model seen in similar sporting events.

According to APIA, there are about 8,000 registered players, and about 35,000 amateurs in India, which is projected to reach 1 million within five years.Pickleball is endorsed by the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney, Selena Gomez, Emma Watson, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf, John McEnroe, Maria Sharapova, Andy Roddick, and Serena Williams.However, barring cricket and kabaddi, most leagues have struggled to capture a significant viewership in India. According to a recent GroupM report, titled Sporting Nation: Building a Legacy, though sports sponsorship, endorsement, and advertising expenses have witnessed a substantial increase in India, it is skewed towards cricket.While expenditure on sporting events have surged from  ₹2,423 crore ($564 million) in 2008 to  ₹15,766 crore ($1.9 billion) in 2023, at a compound annual growth rate of 13%, the Indian Premier League (IPL) alone accounted for  ₹13,701 crore, or 87% of last year's spending.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-09T09:00:16+05:30"},

The Orange Cap winner had scored 741 runs for the Royal Challengers Bengaluru. In the group stage matches, opening batsman Kohli recorded scores of 1, 4, and 0 against Ireland, Pakistan, and the USA respectively.In each of those matches, Kohli was dismissed caught, struggling with deliveries wide of the stump. Against Ireland, he edged a thick outside that was caught by the third-man fielder.In the subsequent match against Pakistan, he couldn't rein in a wide, full-length delivery and ended up scooping it directly to the point fielder. The feared delivery that angled across from left-arm seamer Saurabh Netravalkar led to his undoing in the match against the USA. Deliveries outside the off stump have consistently been a challenge for Kohli.This well-known vulnerability could be exploited by Afghanistan, particularly with Fazhalhaq Farooqi, the tournament's leading wicket-taker and a left-arm seamer, in their ranks. It is clear that they will attempt to capitalize on this by targeting Kohli with the new ball in that specific area.Trott, when asked about plans against Kohli, did not name the Indian skipper, and said, \"We always look at the last couple of innings and see how they go and if there's any trends and those sorts of things when planning for opposition. So yeah, but obviously there's a history of the player as well that you take into account and past experiences of playing against him.\"\"So, everything's taken into account, not just the recent form.

This is the second share buyback in the company’s history. The first was in December 2017. A company can do a share repurchase only once a year. That moratorium ended last month for the company.At its maximum price and size, the buyback will include 103.250 million shares, comprising around 2.36% of the paid-up capital of the company on a standalone basis. The company’s equity comprises 4.36 billion shares.Infosys’ first buyback, at  ₹ 1,150 per share, had returned around  ₹ 13,000 crore to shareholders. In April 2018, Infosys had outlined its capital allocation policy under which it said it intended to return its shareholders  ₹ 2,600 crore in dividend and another  ₹ 10,400 crore through other means, including a buyback.All big IT companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Technologies (HCL) and Wipro announced large share buybacks in the last two years.A share buyback is generally not looked at favourably by investors since it indicates lack of opportunities for the company to utilise cash more effectively. The company, faced with few opportunities to deploy cash and mindful of the fact that a large pile sitting on the books drags down return on equity and hence shareholder value, finds it better to return money to shareholders.In markets such as the US and Europe, large institutional investors do not take kindly to companies sitting on cash and often force them to return money to shareholders through such exercises.", "Published_Date": "2019-01-11T16:55:33+05:30"},

This is the second share buyback after the company returned  ₹ 13,000 crore through its first share buyback completed in December 2017.Infosys also declared a special dividend of  ₹4 per equity share and fixed 25 January as the record date for the special dividend and 28 January as the payment date.In constant currency terms, Infosys’s Q3 revenue rose 2.7% from the preceding three months.Currency fluctuations, however, took some sheen off the company’s growth as dollar revenue increased at a slower pace of 2.2% to $2.98 billion in the quarter ended 31 December.“With increased client relevance, we saw double digit (10.1%) year-on-year growth in Q3 on a constant currency basis,” said Salil Parekh, managing director and chief executive officer of Infosys. “We also had another strong quarter in our digital business with 33.1% growth and large deals at $1.57 billion which gives us confidence entering 2019,” he said.TCS, which declared its Q3 results on Thursday, reported a 1.8% sequential rise in revenue in constant currency terms and 0.67% increase in dollar terms.However, year-on-year, TCS’s 12.1% revenue growth in constant currency terms and 9.7% dollar revenue growth is higher than Infosys’s 10.1% constant currency and 8.4% dollar revenue growth.Infosys’s net profit declined 29.6% to  ₹3,610 crore for the third quarter ended 31 December, against  ₹5,129 crore in the same period a year ago. Operating margin stood at 22.6%, 110 basis points narrower than the 23.7% in the July-September period.100 basis points equal one percentage point.A Bloomberg survey of 20 analysts had estimated a net profit of  ₹4,151.6 crore ($596.92 million) on net sales of  ₹21,294 crore ($3.05 billion).Parekh, who has completed a year as Infosys CEO after taking over the position as the second non-founder of Infosys in January 2018, assuaged concerns of risks related with macroeconomic slowdown in the financial year beginning April. “I’m delighted at the way the year has gone off,” he said.“Infosys surprises positively with strong top-line growth for the quarter, though margin performance misses the mark. Increase in revenue guidance and better exit rate for FY19, provides comfort on double digit growth in FY20. Buyback quantum seems to be below expectation. However, it will support the stock performance in medium term,” said Sanjeev Hota, an analyst at brokerage Sharekhan Ltd.Encouragingly for the company, Infosys won deals worth more than $1.5 billion in the quarter, taking the total value of deals won by the company during the nine months of the financial year to $4.7 billion.Clients from the financial services space, which contributed a third of Infosys’s revenue in the latest quarter, and customers from Europe, who accounted for a fourth of the company’s business, grew 3% and 2.9%, respectively, higher than overall growth.Still, there were a few wrinkles in what was otherwise a decent performance.First, in addition to the decline in profitability, was the management’s decision to abandon its plan of selling Panaya, the automation firm, and Skava, the mobile e-commerce firm.Infosys under earlier CEO Vishal Sikka had spent $370 million to buy the two firms. Last year, Infosys decided to put the two companies on the block, after discounting 59% from the fair value of Panaya. Now Infosys will make investments in the two companies and sell its solutions along with its other offerings.Second, attrition rates at the company continue to be high compared to its rivals. The attrition rate at the IT services business of Infosys was 17.8%, 210 basis points lower than the 19.9% at the end of September quarter.On Friday, Infosys shares rose 0.58%, or  ₹3.95, to R 683.70 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex fell 0.27%, or 96.66 points, to end the day at 36,009.84.

I have been managing my game and administrative duties this way for around six years now.”Suhas said his professional journey started in 2016 while he was the DM of Azamgarh district in eastern UP and a badminton championship was organized there.“I was a guest at the inauguration of the tournament and expressed desire to participate. Until then it was a hobby for me as I had been playing badminton since childhood. I got a chance to play there and defeated state-level players,” he had said.It was there, he said, the Gaurav Khanna, the current coach of the country’s para-badminton team, spotted him and push-started his professional journey.In 2016 itself, he participated in the Asian Championship in Beijing and become the first non-ranked player to win the gold medal.More international recognition was awaiting him as he went on to win medals at BWF Turkish championship in 2017 and 2019 besides the latest, a gold, in Brazil in 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic started ravaging India and world.When his participation in the Tokyo Paralympics was confirmed in July, Suhas said the event was no doubt going to be a challenge and being the world number three in his category, he was hopeful for a medal.“Over the years, we have seen that small margins make the difference between winners and losers. I have lost games with a margin of millimeters and won by centimeters. When I compete in Tokyo, I know every player will be there hoping to win a medal,” Suhas told reporters.However, he said he was not putting himself under any pressure for it, as he cited the teaching of the Bhagvat Geeta.“Do your deed and you will get the results. I am not putting myself under any pressure. If God has brought me to this level, then I am going to put in all my efforts,” he said.", "Published_Date": "2021-09-05T07:48:53+05:30"},

With his quick feet, the Indian managed to keep the rallies short and then was able to clinch the first set by 21-17 in 14 minutes.&nbsp;But it was Krishna who held his nerves better as Man Kai's resistance soon perished as Krishna ran off to a 19-16 lead. Krishna won the third game by 21-17 in 15 minutes. The Indian grabbed the gold medal and Chu Man Kai had to settle with silver.Earlier, Suhas Lalinakere Yathiraj ended his campaign with a historic silver after going down fighting against top seed Lucas Mazur of France in the men's singles SL4 class final.The 38-year-old Noida district magistrate, who has an impairment in one of his ankles, produced an entertaining performance before narrowly going down 21-15 17-21 15-21 to two-time world champion Mazur in a 62-minute summit clash.*With inputs from agencies&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2021-09-05T09:56:02+05:30"},

The Olympics closed almost a month ago.These were unprecedented Olympics and Paralympics, postponed for a year and marked by footnotes and asterisks. No fans were allowed during the Olympics, except for a few thousand at outlying venues away from Tokyo.A few thousand school children were allowed into some Paralympic venues.\"There were many times when we thought these games could not happen,\" Andrew Parsons, president of the International Paralympic Committee, said on Sunday. \"There were many sleepless nights.”The closing ceremony was entitled “Harmonious Cacophony” and involved both able-bodied actors and others with disabilities. The theme was described by organizers as a “world inspired by the Paralympics, one where differences shine.”Like the Olympics, the Paralympics went ahead as Tokyo was under a state of emergency due to the pandemic. Like the Olympics, testing athletes frequently and isolating them in a bubble kept the virus largely at bay, though cases surged among a Japanese population that is now almost 50% fully vaccinated.\"I believe that we have reached the end of games without any major problems,” said Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo organizing committee.But there was fallout, however. Lots of it.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced Friday — two days before the closing — that he would not continue in office. Suga hoped to get a reelection bump from the Olympics. He got the opposite as his approval rating plummeted after a slow vaccine rollout in Japan, and a contentious decision to stage the Games during the pandemic.Suga succeeded Shinzo Abe, who resigned a year ago for health reasons. It was Abe who celebrated in the front row of a Buenos Aires hotel ballroom on Sept. 7, 2013, when then-IOC President Jacques Rogge announced Tokyo as the 2020 host — ahead of Istanbul and Madrid.&nbsp;In a sad coincidence, Rogge died a week ago at 79 after being in poor health.\"Now that Prime Minister Suga is forced out, taking the blame for his failure to combat the coronavirus, it would be impossible to claim that the Olympics and Paralympics were successful, a unifying moments for Japan,” Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University, wrote in an email to The Associated Press.The Paralympics may leave a more tangible legacy in Japan than the Olympics, raising public awareness about people with disabilities and the provision of accessible public space.The Paralympics involved a record number of athletes — 4,405 — and a record number of countries won medals. They also saw two athletes from Afghanistan compete, both of whom arrived several days late after fleeing Kabul.\"The Tokyo Games were a model of efficiency and friendliness,” Olympic historian David Wallechinsky said in an email to The Associated Press. “If it hadn’t been for the Covid-related difficulties, these would be right at or near the top of the best-organized of the 19 Olympics — Summer and Winter — I have attended.”The costs also set records.A study by the University of Oxford found these to be the most expensive Games on record.Japan officially spent USD 15.4 billion to organize the Olympics and Paralympics, double the original estimate. Several government audits suggested the real costs are twice that. All but USD 6.7 billion is public money.The pandemic probably cost organizers almost USD 800 million in lost ticket sales, a budget shortfall that will have to be made up by more government funds. In addition, local sponsors contributed more than USD 3 billion to the operating budget, but got little return with few fans.Toyota, a major Olympics sponsor, pulled its Games-related television advertising in Japan because of public opposition to the Games.Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organizing committee and a former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, framed the costs as an investment. He acknowledged that it’s difficult to sort out what are — and what are not — Olympic costs.\"It has to be scrutinized further to segregate which part is investment and which part is expenditure,” Muto said in an interview last week. “It’s difficult to define the difference.”Tokyo was also haunted by a vote-buying scandal during the bid process that forced the resignation 2 1/2 years ago of Japanese Olympic Committee president Tsunekazu Takeda. He was also an International Olympic Committee member.Next up are the Beijing Winter Olympics, opening in five month. They have been billed as the “Genocide Games” by rights groups that want the Games pulled from China because of the reported internment of at least 1 million Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang in northwestern China.The US Department of State and several other governments have called the human rights violations in Xinjiang a genocide, and one major IOC sponsor — Intel — has said it agrees with the characterization.\"The Covid-related restrictions that were imposed in Tokyo are like a dream come true for the Chinese dictatorship,” Wallechinsky said. “No foreign spectators, fewer foreign media; just what the Communist Party leadership would want. Will athletes protest, and if they do, what will the Chinese do? Deport them? Arrest them? We don’t know.”The IOC, which pushed for Tokyo to go ahead and generated about USD 3 billion-USD 4 billion in television income, has already lined up the next three Summer Olympics; Paris in 2024, Los Angeles in 2028, and Brisbane, Australia, in 2032.The Winter Olympics after Beijing are in Milan-Cortina in Italy in 2026.\"I believe the IOC has to be greatly relieved that the next Games will be in France, Italy and the United States,” Wallechinsky said. “Both Paris and Los Angeles are cities with venues and infrastructure that are already well in place.”Hashimoto, the head of the organizing committee, indicated Sunday that Sapporo would bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics. It was the host city in 1972.\"For 2030, Sapporo will definitely become a candidate,\" Hashimoto said. \"I would hope this would become a reality.\"&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2021-09-05T18:39:17+05:30"},

Amid buzz that cricket may be ignored again at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, ESPNcricinfo has learned that no decision has yet been made and that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will make a final decision in October after the LA28 organisers have finalised the list of new sports by March.  These will then be approved at the IOC session in Mumbai, which is likely to happen in or around October this year.  The six competing teams would most likely be the top six in the ICC men's and women's T20 rankings on a cut-off date, if the plan is approved.  The ICC is presently exploring ideas with the LA28 organisers before deciding on a tournament format, as per ESPNcricinfo.  T20 was suggested as the format because LA28 and the IOC had both informed the ICC that the format should be one in which a world championship is held (which would exclude T10, for example), has a brief duration (which excludes ODIs), and has a sizable amount of spectator engagement.  The IOC's effort to become more cost-effective, which it has outlined as part of its strategic plan named 'Olympic Agenda 2020 5', is the primary reason why the ICC recommends six-team events. It has established that minimising inflated team sizes across disciplines, as well as the overall contingents, is the best method to reduce costs. As a result, there will be 10,500 athletes competing in the 2024 Paris Olympics, down from the 11,300 competitors competing in the 2021 Tokyo Games.  The 2020 5 strategic plan, which supports numerous high-profile events including LA28, includes cost-saving \"opportunities,\" and the IOC has highlighted \"developing the event-based programme with a main focus on simplifying the venue master plan, and decreasing cost and complexity in each sport.\"  Additionally, LA28 informed the ICC that the proposed competition's magnitude could not be compromised and that only the top athletes should participate. This also influenced the decision to only allow the top-six teams from both the male and female genders to compete in the planned event.  The ICC's working group for the Olympics, led by Greg Barclay (ICC chairman), also comprises Paraag Marathe (former USA Cricket president), Indra Nooyi, and Jay Shah, the BCCI secretary.  Shah's inclusion, who serves as both the finance and commercial affairs committee's chair and the BCCI representation on the ICC board, is a calculated move.  Given India's desire to host the Olympics in the forseeable future, the IOC has identified the nation as a major market. And the ICC thinks Shah's presence might give its negotiations with the IOC for cricket to be featured at the sport's largest global event a significant and potentially powerful push.

This is also expected to attract new cricket enthusiasts and promote global infrastructure development for the sport, apart from having a significant economic impact, said experts.Team India is poised to play a crucial role as one of the six teams representing cricket at the 2028 Olympics. To make this a reality, the International Olympic Committee, or IOC, is collaborating with the International Cricket Council (ICC). Over the last two years, ICC developed a proposal to facilitate this inclusion. However, it also entails mandatory doping tests for the Men in Blue.The Olympic Games, with an estimated 3 billion viewers across TV and digital, offers an unparalleled opportunity for cricket to shine on the global stage and potentially reach a wider audience.Cricket is the most popular sport in the Indian subcontinent and a few other South Asian countries, but it doesn’t rank among the top two sports even for many cricket-playing nations.Besides, of late, a significant number of younger fans have shifted away from the 50-over One Day International format, leading to the rise of the T20 format. The ICC has also been working to enhance the sport’s popularity globally. As a part of its efforts it is hosting the upcoming T20 World Cup in US and West Indies. “We are thrilled that cricket’s inclusion in LA28 Olympic Games was confirmed by the IOC Session today. To have an opportunity to showcase our great sport at the LA28 Games and hopefully many Olympic Games to come will be great for the players as well as the fans,” ICC chairman Greg Barclay said.Cricket’s last appearance in the Olympic was in 1900, featuring two teams. The reintegration in the Olympic movement holds the potential to add new regions and enhance its international appeal, said IOC member Nita M. Ambani.Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary Jay Shah has lauded the development for its potential to unlock new horizons. “The board anticipates that this will yield significant financial dividends. It will have a profound positive impact on the sport’s ecosystem. It will fuel infrastructural development, intensify competition, foster youth development, and create opportunities for officials, volunteers, and skilled professionals.”Joy Bhattacharjya, a cricket writer and sports broadcaster, hailed the decision, likening it to ICC’s success in popularizing T20 cricket format, which expanded the sport’s footprint attracting new, younger fans and markets.“With this move, the Olympic Association wants to see how popular the sport will become when introduced at that level, which is good. It could prove to be as important as what ICC did when it made T20 an international competition. Team India will also have to sign up with the World Anti Doping Agency to become complaint within the next four years,” he said.", "Published_Date": "2023-10-16T22:42:27+05:30"},

The Indian employed gut wrench move thrice and mixed that with one 'expose' to finish the bout.The next bout lasted a mere 67 seconds. Cambodia's Smanang Dit was an easy prey. Vinesh pinned her in no time to move to the women's 50kg semifinal.The celebrated Indian faced some resistance from 19-year-old Kazakh wrestler Laura Ganikyzy in the semifinals but she used all her experience to foil the attacks employed by her younger rival.Twice Laura went for left-leg attacks but Vinesh scored on counter and led 4-0 by the end of the first period. This was the first time Vinesh was pushed to the second period in this tournament.Once Vinesh got hold of Laura, she had no problem in employing consecutive gut wrench moves to finish the bout.Vinesh was competing in the 50kg category after winning the selection trials.The finalists at this competition are being awarded quota places for the 2024 Summer Olympics.India can secure three more quotas through Anshu Malik (57kg), Mansi Ahlawat (62kg) and Reetika (76kg) as they have also reached the semifinals in their respective categories.The 2021 World Championship silver medallist Anshu had no problem while putting it across Kyrgyzstan's Kalmira Bilimbekova in the quarterfinal, winning by technical superiority.The U23 world champion Reetika did not have to break much sweat in outclassing Eunju Hwang.She won the first round by technical superiority as the Korean had no answer to Reetika's class and got a similar win under her belt against Mongolia's Davaanasan Enkh Amar.In the final group bout against China's Juang Wang, Reetika raced to a 8-0 lead but the Chinese fought back and logged six straight points.She effected another move at the dying moments but much to the relief of the Indian camp, that point was not awarded because it came at the end of the stipulated time.Mansi also made it to last-four as she needed to win just one bout. Up against Kazakhstan's Irina Kuznetsova, she emerged a 6-4 winner.The only Indian wrestler who could not reach semifinals was Nisha Dahiya (68kg).Nisha had to work hard for her opening win against Sol Gum Pak from North Korea. The Indian had raced to a 5-0 lead and maintained that till the first period, but the Korean put the pressure back on her rival with a strong resistance.Immediately at the start of the second period, Pak successfully got a take-down move to get on to the scoreboard. However, Nisha kept pushing Pak out to extend her lead and eventually won 8-3.Already exhausted, Nisha was outclassed by local favourite Meerim Zhumanazarova in round 2, in which she suffered a heavy defeat.After falling behind 1-9, she was pinned by Meerim. Nisha could hardly employ any attacking move, and was mostly involved in standing wrestling.In the must-win round 3, Nisha overpowered Kazakhstan's Yelena Shalygina but with Meerim losing her final group bout, Nisha did not have enough points to stay in top-four.The last chance to win the Paris Games quota will be at the World Qualifiers in Turkey from May 9.", "Published_Date": "2024-04-20T22:01:22+05:30"},

After the news of the scam in the NEET exam, now the NET exam held on June 18 has also been cancelled due to the fear of irregularities.”3) Congress spokesperson Surendra Singh Rajput criticised the BJP government over the paper leak issue, asking the reason behind the NEET UG 2024 and UGC NET June exam controversies. “BJP government have to tell what is the reason that all the papers are getting leaked...The government will have to tell who is responsible, who is in cahoots with the copy mafia, what is his hold in the government and power that he is still out of the grip of the police and why these papers get leaked every time.”4) \"Now the government is saying that the UGC NET paper has been cancelled, we will get the CBI to investigate. But what will happen to the future of the children? The responsible officials and ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government should resign. If you cannot run the government, then resign. INDIA bloc will run the government, but please stop this paper leakage because the country will get demoralised,” the Congress leader said.5) Shiv Sena (UBT) spokesperson Anand Dubey said, “The future of 24 lakh students is hanging because of the paper leak of the NEET-UG exam. Now, the government has cancelled the UGC-NET because of a paper leak.”6) “Is the NTA so careless? No one is ready to take the responsibility. Where is the PM, the Union Home Minister and the Education Minister?” Dubey asked.7) Varun Choudhary, National President NSUI on the cancellation of UGC-NET 2024 exam urged the BJP government and Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan to take strict action against the NTA. “NTA should be immediately banned and strict action should be taken against them.”8) “Cancel #NEET too! The examination is devoid of integrity,” Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram after the education ministry cancelled the NET exam.9) Rajnish Rana, a student in Delhi, expressed his concern over the NET exam cancellation as he appeared for the same on June 18. “I was very sad to hear that the paper has been cancelled because my exam went well this time. I was really hopeful this time. It is really unfortunate that an organisation like NTA is not able to conduct such exams properly,” he said.10) “NTA Fails! 1. NEET Scam 2. CUET PG Marks given to some candidates 3. NCET exams cancelled 4. Now UGC NET cancelled. We urge the @EduMinOfIndia to abolish @NTA_Exams and bring education back to state list!” netizens said on X.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-20T09:53:12+05:30"},

Each summer, millions of Indians face acute water shortages as demand surges in farms, offices, and homes, far outstripping the limited supply. This year, a prolonged heatwave has further strained water resources, particularly in the capital Delhi, and the southern tech hub of Bengaluru.\"This is detrimental to the credit health of the sovereign, as well as sectors that heavily consume water, such as coal power generators and steel-makers,\" Moody’s Ratings stated in a note.

The ministry considers levels below 1,700 cubic meters indicative of water stress, with 1,000 cubic meters marking the threshold for water scarcity.As Delhi grapples with the water crisis, the situation underscores the urgent need for sustainable water management solutions across the country. The combination of local challenges and national-level concerns highlights the critical importance of addressing water scarcity to ensure economic stability and public health.(With Inputs from Agencies)", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T10:53:45+05:30"},

The SIPs serve as an effective vehicle for accumulating wealth gradually over time, making them ideal for long-term investment strategies. They are particularly recommended for newcomers aiming to build wealth steadily over the years.The SIP investments offer valuable advantages for all kinds of investors interested in wealth creation.Accessible initial investment: Putting money in the market through SIPs enables you to begin with a manageable, predetermined amount, eliminating the need for a significant upfront sum.In contrast to conventional investing, which may demand a substantial initial investment, SIPs typically feature minimal minimum investment thresholds. This characteristic renders them particularly suitable for novices with limited starting capital. SIPs enable you to commit to investing a predetermined amount at regular intervals, such as monthly. This systematic approach facilitates the gradual accumulation of your investment portfolio, simplifying financial management.By diversifying your investments over time, SIPs can be seamlessly integrated into various budgetary constraints. You have the flexibility to select a contribution amount that harmonises with your income and overall financial standing.Cultivating discipline: With a consistent investment schedule, SIPs foster discipline and nurture a habit of regular saving. SIPs facilitate initiating investments with smaller, more manageable sums, enhancing adherence to your investment strategy. The emphasis lies on regularity rather than hefty lump sums. Additionally, numerous platforms offer automation features for SIP investments, streamlining the process by deducting predetermined amounts from your account at selected intervals. This automation minimises the requirement for manual involvement and reinforces your dedication.Witnessing the gradual growth of your investment, even with modest contributions, serves as significant motivation. This continual progress fosters discipline and sustains your investment commitment.Emphasis on long-term growth: SIPs prioritise the creation of wealth over the long haul. While initial returns may appear modest, the beauty lies in their reinvestment alongside subsequent contributions. This mechanism allows you to earn returns not only on your principal investment but also on the compounded returns from earlier periods. It mirrors a snowball effect, gradually amplifying your wealth over time. The potency of compounding manifests its true prowess over extended durations.Rupee-cost averaging: Through periodic investments, SIPs facilitate purchasing units at varying market prices, potentially smoothing out the average cost per unit over time. This potent strategy aids in mitigating market volatility and potentially reducing your long-term investment expenses. Given the fluctuations in the stock market, investing a fixed amount at regular intervals allows you to acquire units at varying price levels—some high, some low. During market downturns, your fixed SIP amount purchases more units, effectively lowering your average cost per unit.Conversely, during market highs, your fixed investment buys fewer units, preventing you from allocating a larger sum at the peak. Through this consistent purchasing approach, rupee-cost averaging works to normalise the overall cost per unit for your mutual fund or stock investments. This mechanism proves particularly advantageous in volatile markets, potentially resulting in a lower average cost compared to lump-sum investors who enter the market at an inopportune time.tMarket timing independent: Investing via SIPs alleviates the need to pinpoint the ideal market entry moment, allowing for consistent investments irrespective of market fluctuations. Rather than agonising over the optimal market entry point, SIPs enable you to prioritise consistent investment. This alleviates the burden of forecasting market shifts, a task that even seasoned investors find challenging.Through regular investments of a fixed amount, you leverage the advantages of rupee-cost averaging, effectively tempering the influence of market volatility over time. Therefore, SIPs eliminate the need for market timing guesswork and promote disciplined, consistent investing—a formula that often leads to enduring success in the market.In summary, SIPs prove to be a robust instrument suitable for both novices and seasoned investors. They foster discipline, encourage diversification, and capitalise on long-term growth potential through compounding.Compounding is a universal concept, and investments are no different. However, while the concept holds allure in theory, its application in investments often falls short. In practice, our minds are besieged by greed and fear, thwarting the realisation of its magic. Those who have mastered this code have amassed wealth beyond the dreams of others. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-17T12:30:45+05:30"},

What, according to you, prompted them all of a sudden to focus on the manufacturing theme?The emphasis that the government is lying to step up manufacturing is one of the major causes. Just as we saw India go through the green revolution in agriculture, the white revolution in dairy and later the services revolution in the late 90s, we seemed to have sidestepped manufacturing, and this is being rectified now with the government targeting manufacturing to reach 25% of GDP in 2047 from 17% currently. Even assuming a 6% growth of GDP, the manufacturing size can expand by more than six times from current levels.This is buoyed further by schemes like PLI and OSAT. In addition, we see global trends on near-shoring, climate change, industry 4.0 & digitisation prompting a revival globally.What is the current contribution of the manufacturing sector to India’s GDP? How do you foresee its trajectory in the future?We are assuming GDP to compound only at 6% and if we assume that we manage to expand manufacturing share only by 500 bps (17% to 22%), the market will likely be 5X of what it is currently. We believe if the government thrust remains intact this kind of growth in the manufacturing landscape is feasible.The incumbent government has returned to power. Do you view this as a boost to the “Make in India” initiative?Frankly, none of the political parties are anti-development. However, focus areas do change marginally. The good part of continuity is that there is no reset and restart in the overall thinking so it can build upon the policies and priorities decided over the last 10 years. To that extent, the baton passing is smooth and without hiccups.What makes a manufacturing fund preferable for investors over other options like flexi cap or small-cap funds, despite offering similar advantages?As we emphasise manufacturing from a strategic view, services share may come off from the current 54% which means the growth would be lesser than the GDP growth. As we are aware the benchmarks for most indices would have service sectors at about 50% which this fund would not have exposure to and hence may give superior alpha to unit holders.To add, the global themes mentioned earlier also boost the export opportunity across areas such as autos, industrials, and pharma. We see increasing examples of multinational corporations using India as a sourcing centre.Is this the right time to bet on manufacturing funds?We have seen a large part of PLI, OSAT, and defence platform orders (under “Atmanirbhar Bharat”) being awarded in FY24 which gives an indication of the government walking the talk. One could argue that certain pockets, especially, in industrials have run up sharply but as mentioned earlier the theme isn’t narrow and we see enough options for creating a sound portfolio across sectors. As a result, we do believe that the time is apt to look at this theme in earnest.The recently launched AMFI data saw more people investing money in thematic funds despite their inherent volatility. As a fund manager, do you support the idea of investing in thematic funds like the manufacturing fund?It’s an interesting question. Any narrow subject does inherently have higher risk-return trade-offs. The good part of manufacturing as you can see from its benchmarks is that it gravitates across auto & auto ancillaries, industrials/capital goods, pharma, oil & gas, metals/mining & chemicals apart from some smaller sectors. So, it is not as narrow as certain thematic funds as one has ample manoeuvring space reducing the risks.What are the inherent risks involved in putting money in funds following the manufacturing theme?One macro risk is that if the government’s intent to step up manufacturing falters, the theme may not work as envisaged. Large parts of manufacturing are vulnerable to commodity price spikes in relation to their margins hence these can prove to be temporary headwinds in stock performance.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-17T12:45:17+05:30"},

In India, equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) offer a compelling choice for investors aiming to optimize tax benefits alongside wealth creation.Below is a table showcasing some of the top-performing ELSS funds that can significantly bolster your long-term investment portfolio.Ironically, many investors hastily enter ELSS funds believing it’s merely another type of equity fund aimed at wealth creation, often overlooking the inherent benefits unique to each fund. Here’s why ELSS can be highly appealing:Tax advantagesELSS fund investments provide significant tax savings under Section 80C. Here’s an overview of the tax benefits:Deduction of up to  ₹1.5 lakh: Investing in ELSS allows you to reduce your taxable income by up to Rs. 1.5 lakh annually. Depending on your tax bracket, this can substantially decrease your tax liability.Reduced tax obligation: Lowering your taxable income through ELSS investments results in overall reduced tax payments. This provides additional funds that can be reinvested or allocated towards achieving other financial objectives.Potential for growthThe growth potential of ELSS is a significant advantage. Here’s a closer look at why:Equity-focused: ELSS funds invest in stocks, offering the potential for higher returns compared to fixed-income tax-saving alternatives such as the Public Provident Fund (PPF) or National Savings Certificates (NSCs). Historically, the stock market has delivered strong long-term returns, making ELSS a preferred choice for wealth accumulation.Long-term perspective: ELSS funds are typically recommended for an investment tenure of 5-10 years or more. This approach helps investors weather market fluctuations and capitalize on the compounding of returns over time.Structured investingUtilizing ELSS funds offers a method to instill regularity in your investment approach. Through a systematic investment plan (SIP), you consistently invest a predetermined amount, leveraging rupee-cost averaging. ELSS paired with SIPs thus form an effective strategy for cultivating disciplined investing habits.SIPs promote consistency: Establishing a regular investment amount removes emotional decision-making, preventing the urge to invest more during market highs and less during lows.Rupee-cost averaging: Through SIPs, you acquire units at various price levels over time, smoothing out the average unit cost despite market fluctuations.ELSS lock-in period fosters a long-term perspective: The mandatory three-year lock-in period of ELSS funds deters impulsive reactions to market volatility, encouraging sustained investment for optimal returns typically associated with equities over the long run.For investors with a long-term perspective (usually five years or more), the lock-in period and market volatility of ELSS funds become less worrisome as market fluctuations tend to stabilize over time.Selecting the appropriate ELSS fund necessitates thorough research into its performance, investment approach, and risk characteristics. It should align closely with your overarching investment objectives.By comprehensively assessing both the advantages and potential risks, you can confidently determine whether ELSS fits well within your investment portfolio. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-17T17:13:01+05:30"},

Gyanchandani", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/ca-rohit-j-gyanchandani", "Content": "When investing in mutual funds, examining the past returns of the schemes you’re interested in is a crucial step. There are several ways to calculate these returns, with XIRR and CAGR being two popular methods.Choosing between XIRR and CAGR depends on the nature of your investment and the frequency of cash flows. XIRR is ideal for irregular investments, while CAGR works well for steady investments. Both methods help you gauge the performance of your mutual fund investments over time. Both have their own merits depending on the context of the investment. Here’s a brief overview of each method:XIRRXIRR, or Extended Internal Rate of Return, is a method used to calculate the annualised return on investment when cash flows occur at irregular intervals. It considers all cash inflows and outflows, along with their respective dates, to determine the annual rate of return. XIRR takes into account the timing and amount of each cash flow, making it a more precise method for investments with irregular cash flows.For portfolio investors, XIRR is invaluable for assessing and distinguishing the performance of individual stocks within their portfolios. It helps identify which shares are causing losses or offsetting gains. When dealing with Systematic Investment Plans (SIP), calculating returns can be complex due to multiple investments with varying prices and time periods. Therefore, XIRR is commonly used to compute returns for SIP, simplifying the process for investors.Advantages of XIRR1. Accounts for uneven cash flows - XIRR considers the time value of money and the timing of cash flows, making it suitable for investments with irregular or uneven cash flows.2. Provides accurate return calculation - XIRR offers a more precise calculation of the return on investment by considering both the magnitude and timing of cash flows.Disadvantages of XIRR1. May be difficult to calculate manually - XIRR manually can be challenging, especially for investments with numerous cash flows and changing rates of return.2. May not provide a clear picture of long-term performance - XIRR calculates the annualised return over the entire investment period, which may not provide a clear picture of the long-term performance of the investment.CAGRCAGR, or Compound Annual Growth Rate, is a method used to calculate the annualised return on investment when cash flows occur at regular intervals. It assumes a constant rate of growth over a specific period and calculates the average rate of return during that period. CAGR is particularly useful for understanding the growth rate of an investment over time, especially for long-term investments like mutual funds.Advantages of CAGR1. Simple to calculate - CAGR is a straightforward formula that can be easily calculated using basic arithmetic.2. Provides a clear picture of long-term performance - CAGR gives a clear picture of the average annual return of an investment over a specific period, making it useful for long-term investments.Disadvantages of CAGR1. Does not account for the timing of cash flows - CAGR assumes that cash flows are evenly spaced over the investment period, which may not be the case for investments with irregular or uneven cash flows.2. Can be misleading for volatile investments - CAGR may not accurately reflect the performance of an investment with high volatility, as it assumes a steady rate of return over the entire investment period.XIRR vs CAGRXIRR and CAGR are both valuable tools for evaluating mutual fund investments, but they are used in different scenarios due to their distinct characteristics.XIRR is typically used when evaluating funds with irregular cash flows, such as additional investments or withdrawals made at different points in time. It considers the timing and amount of each cash flow, providing a more accurate measure of the annualised return.CAGR, on the other hand, is commonly used when evaluating funds with regular cash flows. It assumes a constant rate of growth over a specific period, making it ideal for comparing funds that have a consistent investment pattern.CAGR is suitable for calculating returns from lump sum investments, while XIRR is preferable for calculating returns from periodic investments like SIPs. While CAGR measures the annualised compounded return on investment, XIRR measures the average return earned by the investor after factoring in periodic cash flows separately.In conclusion, when it comes to calculating mutual fund returns, the choice between XIRR and CAGR depends on the nature of the cash flows. If the cash flows are irregular or occur at different intervals, XIRR is the preferred method as it considers the timing and amount of each cash flow. This makes it more accurate for investments with irregular cash flows.On the other hand, if the cash flows are regular and occur at consistent intervals, CAGR is more appropriate. CAGR provides a simplified measure of the average annual return over a specified time period, making it suitable for investments with regular cash flows.In summary, choose XIRR for investments with irregular cash flows and CAGR for investments with regular cash flows. Understanding the nature of the cash flows will help you determine which method is best suited for calculating the returns on your mutual funds.Rohit Gyanchandani is Managing Director at Nandi Nivesh Private Limited ;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-19T08:58:15+05:30"},

I am a small businessman running a small construction firm. My wife is an interior designer working as a freelancer. We have been investing in index mutual funds and large-cap funds for the past 5 years. We now intend to diversify our portfolio and invest in index funds tracking the US stock market. Can you please elaborate on the S&P 500 index and the pros and cons of investing in a mutual fund tracking S&P 500 index?Gaurav Vasvani, Delhi, New DelhiThe S&P 500 index, a leading indicator of US equities, is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap US stocks. There’s a good reason for this: the index covers approximately 80% of the available market capitalization. For many, it is the benchmark against which all other investments are measured.The origin and evolutionThe S&P 500 was introduced by Standard & Poor’s in 1957 as a stock market index to track the value of 500 large corporations listed on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. It is a market-capitalization-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher market values have a more significant impact on the index’s price movements.Why the S&P 500 mattersInvestors and financial analysts pay close attention to the S&P 500 for several reasons:Diversification: The index provides a broad snapshot of the market by including companies from all sectors.Performance tracking: It serves as a proxy for the overall market’s health and is used to benchmark the performance of individual stocks and other indexes.Investment vehicle: Many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) aim to track the performance of the S&P 500, making it accessible for individual investors to gain exposure to the market’s returns.Historical performanceThe S&P 500 has seen its fair share of ups and downs, reflecting the dynamic nature of the US economy and global financial markets. For instance, the index experienced significant growth in the late 20th century, punctuated by the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s and the financial crisis of 2007-2008. More recently, the index has reached new heights, with record closings and a steady uptrend in the past few years.The S&P 500 todayAs of mid-2024, the S&P 500 continues to be a critical measure of economic and investment conditions. The index has shown resilience and growth, bouncing back from lows and reaching new highs. This performance is a testament to the robust nature of the US economy and the strength of its largest companies.The future of the S&P 500Predicting the future of the S&P 500 is as challenging as predicting the economy itself. However, historical trends show that despite short-term volatility, the index has provided solid long-term returns for investors. As the US and global economies evolve, the S&P 500 will continue to be a crucial barometer for investors and analysts alike.Investing in Indian mutual funds that track the S&P 500 index can be an attractive proposition for investors looking to diversify their portfolio internationally, especially with exposure to the US stock market. However, like any investment, it comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here’s a detailed look at the pros and cons.ProsDiversification: By investing in funds that track the S&P 500, investors can gain exposure to 500 of the largest US based companies, spanning various industries. This helps in spreading out the risk as opposed to investing in a single stock or sector.Professional management: These funds are managed by professionals who ensure that the fund’s portfolio mirrors the index it tracks, thus relieving investors from the need to actively manage their investments.Cost-effectiveness: Index funds typically have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds because they are passively managed. This means lower costs for investors over time.Simplicity: For investors who wish to invest in the US market without the complexity of picking individual stocks, these mutual funds offer a straightforward approach.Liquidity: Indian mutual funds tracking the S&P 500 are generally highly liquid, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions.ConsCurrency risk: Since these funds invest in US stocks, there is a currency risk due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the US Dollar.Geopolitical risks: The performance of the S&P 500 is influenced by the economic and political events in the US, which may not always align with the Indian market’s performance.Limited potential for outperformance: Index funds aim to replicate the performance of the index they track. Therefore, they generally do not outperform the market.Tax considerations: For Indian investors, gains from international mutual funds may be taxed differently compared to domestic funds, which could affect net returns.TaxationThe taxation of mutual funds in India is primarily dependent on the type of fund and the duration of the investment. For mutual funds that invest in international stocks, such as those tracking the S&P 500, the tax treatment differs from domestic equity funds. Funds investing in the S&P 500 are typically classified as non-equity-oriented funds for tax purposes. This means they are taxed like debt funds, despite investing in equities. The rationale is that they do not meet the threshold of investing 65% in Indian equities. Therefore, for an Indian investor, gains from these funds will be taxed as per the rules applicable to debt funds.Short-term and long-term capital gains taxInvestments in mutual funds are subject to capital gains tax, which is categorised into short-term capital gains (STCG) and long-term capital gains (LTCG). The classification between short-term and long-term is based on the holding period of the investment.For mutual funds tracking the S&P 500 index, gains realised on investments held for less than 36 months are considered short-term and are added to the investor’s income, taxed according to the applicable income tax slab rates.Long-term capital gains, on the other hand, apply to investments held for more than 36 months. The LTCG on these funds was taxed at the rate of 20% after providing the benefit of inflation indexation until April 2023.Taxation changes post-April 2023It’s important to note that if the investment in the mutual fund was made on or after April 1, 2023, the entire amount of gain is added to the investor’s income and taxed according to the applicable slab rate. This change emphasises the need for investors to be aware of the timing of their investments and the corresponding tax implications.Tax planning considerationsInvestors should consider the tax implications as part of their overall investment strategy. Understanding the nuances of taxation can help in selecting the right mutual fund and deciding the investment horizon. It’s also advisable to consult with a tax professional to understand the specific impact on one’s financial situation.Investing in mutual funds that target the S&P 500 can be an attractive proposition for diversification and exposure to international markets. However, investors must be cognizant of the tax implications that classify these funds alongside debt mutual funds. Understanding these nuances can help in making informed investment decisions and optimising post-tax returns.The S&P 500 index is more than just a number—it’s a reflection of the US economy’s strength and the corporate giants that lead it. Whether you’re an investor seeking to understand market trends or a casual observer of financial news, the S&P 500 offers valuable insights into the workings of the US stock market and, by extension, the global economy.The S&P 500 index remains a cornerstone of financial indices and will continue to be a key player in the investment world for years to come.In conclusion, while investing in Indian mutual funds tracking the S&P 500 index can provide a convenient way to invest in the US stock market and diversify one’s portfolio, investors must carefully consider their investment objectives, risk tolerance, and the impact of currency and geopolitical risks. It’s also crucial to understand the tax implications and the fact that these funds are designed to match the market performance, not beat it. As with any investment decision, due diligence and a clear understanding of one’s financial goals are paramount.Disclaimer: Investing in mutual funds involves risks, including potential loss of principal.

While this reality may be harsh, determining how much to save and invest from one’s modest earnings can feel overwhelming.Nevertheless, the encouraging news is that even modest sums can accumulate significantly over time, and there are effective strategies to simplify the process of saving. Here are some tips to help you begin:Begin modestly: There’s no need to feel compelled to set aside a large portion of your paycheck immediately. Start with a manageable sum, whether it’s just 5% or 10%. Over time, you can incrementally raise this percentage as you become more accustomed to saving.Automate your savings: Arrange for automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account each payday. This method ensures you prioritize saving and reduces the temptation to spend the money elsewhere.Monitor your spending: Understanding your expenditure patterns is crucial for identifying areas where you can reduce costs. Numerous budgeting apps and tools are accessible to assist you in this task.Distinguish between necessities and desires: Prioritize essential expenses such as rent, groceries, and utilities. Then, be mindful of discretionary spending on luxuries such as dining out or spontaneous purchases.Investigate affordable investment opportunities: Explore investment avenues that require minimal initial investments, such as fractional shares or robo-advisors. These options enable you to commence investing with smaller sums of money.Achieving substantial wealth with a modest income is entirely feasible. Although it may appear challenging at first, the fundamental principles remain applicable. Yet, your ambition must align with your determination and strategy.How can you reach your financial objectives?This question appears straightforward but lacks a singular or easy answer. Determining how much to save and invest is not straightforward, especially with inflation eroding a significant portion of your income.Consider the following example to illustrate this point. Beginning with a 5% investment of your income is an excellent starting point. It’s a manageable figure that helps establish a consistent habit of saving and investing.While you might be tempted to begin with a larger sum, delaying until you’ve accumulated a substantial amount before investing could mean missing out on the advantages of starting early in life. Starting with 5% is a feasible percentage for most budgets, even with limited income. It’s less likely to make you feel deprived and more likely to foster long-term commitment.Then, choose an equity mutual fund to invest in. In youth, there’s often a willingness to take risks. You might be tempted to begin with a thematic fund without fully considering its volatility. Instead, consider starting with a large-cap fund, such as a blue-chip mutual fund. ;Investing a portion of your savings in these funds can establish a strong base for building wealth, particularly for those starting with limited investment capital or with a lower risk appetite. Blue-chip companies have a proven track record of financial stability and success, offering more predictable returns compared to riskier alternatives.Your salary will vary over time. Job changes or annual appraisals often result in raises, providing opportunities to increase your income. You can use this additional money to enhance your investments or explore alternative investment opportunities.If you choose to increase your investments by 5% annually, and even if you achieve just the minimum 12% return typical of underperforming mutual funds in the long term, you could potentially accumulate  ₹1,11,90,349. Over 30 years, this strategy could grow your total to  ₹1,31,83,515.Above all, resist becoming accustomed to the raise. Guard against lifestyle inflation, where you raise your spending in line with your increased income. This could diminish the potential advantages of the raise. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-19T13:27:28+05:30"},

It has committed to installing 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, marking one of the most ambitious expansion plans in the world. India’s progress is evident as it currently ranks as the world’s 4th largest installer of renewable energy, with its solar and wind power industries experiencing rapid growth.What propels India’s green energy sector?India’s renewable energy sector is thriving, driven by a confluence of compelling factors. Let’s explore the key forces accelerating this dynamic growth:The Indian government has been instrumental in promoting renewable energy through supportive policies such as feed-in tariffs, subsidies for solar panels, and tax incentives for renewable energy firms.The decreasing costs of renewables, propelled by technological advancements, have substantially reduced the expense of solar panels and wind turbines, thereby enhancing the financial viability of renewable energy in comparison to conventional fossil fuels.Energy security is a critical issue for India due to its heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, which are susceptible to price swings and geopolitical issues. By expanding its renewable energy infrastructure, India can diminish its dependency on foreign oil and achieve a more reliable energy supply.Addressing climate change is paramount for India, given its heightened vulnerability to its effects. Expanding the green energy sector is essential for India to curb greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the effects of climate change.As India’s population continues to grow rapidly, so does the demand for electricity. Embracing renewable energy provides a clean and sustainable solution to meet this escalating demand for power.India’s ambitious objectives, supported by these compelling factors, establish the country as a frontrunner in the global shift towards clean energy. This illustrates why investors are increasingly drawn to investing in the green energy sector.Investing in green energy mutual fundsPutting your money into green energy mutual funds is an excellent method to ensure your investments reflect your principles. These funds focus on companies leading in renewable energy and clean technologies, enabling you to contribute to climate change solutions while possibly achieving strong financial returns.The following table illustrates some top mutual fund houses that turned their attention towards the energy sector to harness the benefits from this sector.There are other funds too invested partially in this sector. These include:Opting for a green energy mutual fund provides diversification across multiple companies in the sector, thereby lowering risk compared to selecting individual stocks.

Choosing STP enables you to regularly transfer a set amount at scheduled intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly) from one mutual fund scheme (source scheme) to another (target scheme) within the same fund house.Why use the STP option for equity investing?The STP offers a hassle-free method for consistent investing without the need for manual transaction initiation each time. You have the flexibility to tailor your STP according to your investment objectives and risk appetite by specifying the amount, frequency, and selecting the source and target funds. Although not assured, equity funds typically offer greater return potential compared to debt funds. By incrementally boosting your exposure to equities through STP, you can potentially enhance your long-term investment outcomes.Financial advisors advocate for using the STP option for equity investing due to several important factors:Rupee-cost averaging: The stock market is volatile, with fluctuating prices. By consistently investing a fixed amount through STP, you purchase more units when prices are low and fewer when they are high. This strategy helps to average the cost per unit over time, offering potential benefits in equity markets prone to volatility.Structured investing: Opting for STP instills discipline in your investment approach. By establishing a fixed amount and frequency, transfers occur automatically, reducing the urge to time the market or let emotions sway your decisions.Incremental exposure: For novice investors or those with a conservative risk appetite, STP provides a method to slowly expand exposure to equities. Beginning with investments in a debt fund, you can gradually shift portions into an equity fund using STP. This approach aids in developing confidence in managing the inherent volatility of the stock market.Portfolio rebalancing: As time progresses, the composition of your asset allocation—comprising various investments in your investment portfolio—can become unbalanced. For instance, if equity prices increase, their share in your portfolio may exceed your intended allocation. STP offers a strategic approach to systematically transfer funds from equities to debt funds, thereby helping you uphold your desired asset allocation.Emotionally detached investing: Market volatility often prompts emotional reactions, causing investors to make hasty decisions such as selling during downturns. STP eliminates emotional factors by automating the investment process.STPs don’t need a lump sum upfront, even though they are advantageous for equity investments. Any amount that you are consistently comfortable with can be used to start with this option. However, choosing the STP option can be a wise move if you have a lump sum and are afraid to invest it all at once because of market volatility. Using the STP, you can first park the lump sum in a debt fund and then progressively move it to an equity fund. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-20T13:24:56+05:30"},

The parameter of popularity is of course not the best one as periodically, different categories tend to hog the limelight based on the near-term returns they generate. So, for example, small and midcap funds have been the rockstars of the last few years.But generally, the two categories of flexi cap funds and large cap funds are the evergreen ones. As per the last AMFI monthly data (May-2024), there were 39 schemes with a total AUM of  ₹3.73 lakh crore in Flexicap category and 31 schemes with an AUM of  ₹3.23 lakh crore in large cap funds (not passive ones).Most investor portfolios tend to have schemes from both categories these days. But is it necessary? We will explore and try to answer a question in this article – and that is - Is flexi cap fund enough or you need to have a large cap fund as well in your mutual fund portfolio?But given the similarities in how at times both are managed by the fund manager (more about similarities in a bit), is there really a case for having schemes from both categories in your portfolio? Or having funds from just one category is enough?Before that, let’s see what the SEBI categorization rules have to say about these two categories and how they differ:Large cap funds are required to invest 80% minimum in large cap stocks (these are stocks of companies that are in the top-100 by market cap).Flexi cap funds, as their name suggests, have a lot more flexibility. The fund manager has the freedom to invest across stocks of businesses from different market caps without any restriction/requirement on maximum/minimum allocation. So, at least theoretically, a flexicap fund manager has full freedom to invest any proportion as he likes (or as per his strategy) in stocks from large-, mid- and smallcap segments.What this means is that if one is interested in investing purely in shares of large companies, then the large cap category is best suited as it gives equity exposure to some of the largest Indian businesses. On the other hand, if one wants a mix of all the segments (large/ mid/ small), then flexicap is a better choice.If this is so, then what is the problem?Why can’t investors have both funds in their portfolio?That is entirely feasible and nothing wrong in investing in both.But there is a small thing that most common investors don’t know about flexi cap funds. This requires one to dig deeper and analyse individual fund portfolios. So, what is this small thing?Remember that the large cap funds are required ‘mandatorily’ to invest at least 80% in large cap stocks. There are no such restrictions like this in flexi cap funds though. But the problem is that a vast majority of the 39 schemes in the flexicap category tend to have a very high allocation to large cap stocks. From 60% to almost 75% in a few schemes.Now you may say that it might be a fund manager’s strategy to invest more in large caps based on their then ‘current’ view about the market and conditions. While this might be true occasionally and to some extent, it doesn’t provide full justification.A more probable reason (and don’t expect fund managers to agree to this as they have a job to do) is that given how big many flexi cap funds have become, at times, there are not enough ways to deploy large amounts of money that they get in inflows every month. Large cap stocks have enough liquidity and scale to absorb such money.But given the nature of small and mid cap stocks and their much limited scale/ liquidity, it often becomes very difficult to buy large chunks of shares in these smaller companies without disrupting their prices. Hence, flexi cap funds tend to have a bias towards large caps.To be fair, the bias towards large cap stocks, while there is in most flexi cap funds, there are still few who don’t follow the herd. Many such flexi cap funds have a decent allocation to mid caps and small caps as well.So, what should you do?Let me list down a few pointers to help you decide:If you have a conservative risk profile and just want a small equity allocation, then keep things simple and do it via pure large cap funds. In fact, you can just pick passive large cap funds and can ignore active ones fully. And you just need one fund in a large cap. Don’t invest in multiple schemes from this category.It is important to understand that different flexicap fund managers follow different strategies and styles. So, one can have up to 2 flexi cap funds because both offer something unique. But generally, for smaller portfolios, just one from the flexicap fund category would be enough.If you have a Balanced risk profile, then you can invest in both. While there will be certain overlaps, that should be fine. Having funds from both will allow you to have a predominantly large cap-oriented resultant portfolio with a comparatively smaller allocation to mid-small cap stocks via flexi cap fund.And what if you are an aggressive investor? In that case, one can just go for flexi cap funds and not have any pure largecap plays. Though still having funds from both categories isn’t exactly wrong.Dev Ashish is a Sebi-registered investment adviser and the founder of Stable Investor ;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T09:19:03+05:30"},

While presenting the Union Budget 2022-23, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the use of surety bonds as a substitute for bank guarantees will be made acceptable in government procurement.What are surety bonds?Surety bonds are third-party guarantees issued by the insurance companies on behalf of the applicant (i.e. on behalf of&nbsp;whom the guarantee is to be provided)“Surety Bonds are issued to Beneficiaries and Authorities (i.e. corporations that accept the guarantee). Fundamentally, it is similar to any Non-Fund limits provided by banks to provide Bank Guarantees and LCs,” said Sanjay Kedia, CEO and Country Head, Marsh India Insurance Brokers.Last week, IRDAI Chairman, Debasish Panda urged stakeholders in the infrastructure sector to take advantage of offered surety bonds, which complement bank guarantees needed for large-scale funding.Why Irdai chief stress the need to make use of surety bonds to complement bank guarantees?IRDAI Chairman, Debasish Panda had mentioned that India is planning to spend almost  ₹100 lakh crore+ on infrastructure in the next 5 years, which will generate a need for bonds worth almost  ₹90 lakh crore in the next five years.&nbsp;As per Sanjay Kedia, the current banking setup would urgently need additional support from alternative financing mechanisms to support such a demand for capital of this scale. &nbsp;The IRDAI issued the Surety guidelines in 2022 which present a significant opportunity for Indian general insurers to complement the bank guarantee mechanism used by banks by providing alternative options for funding, he added.Purpose of surety bondsThe purpose is to provide corporates an alternative for Non-Fund limits, which are more likely than not, uncollateralized and free of margin money/cash marginsAs per Head, Marsh India, in some scenarios, the surety company can also provide a conditional guarantee, where the beneficiary is the private corporation and the chances of the unfair calling of the guarantee are minimised.Benefits of surety bondsSanjay Kedia, CEO and Country Head, Marsh India listed four benefits of surety bonds1)Diversified source of non-fund based limits2)Easing of liquidity pressures3)The ability for companies to participate in more orders4)Project owners enjoy participation from a larger bidding group which helps them get a fair value for the bidDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts, and not of Mint.

Travel insurance now assumes greater importance than ever before. Travel insurance is very important especially while you are travelling abroad. Let us discuss what it covers and when one should buy it.What is covered under the travel insuranceThough the word “Travel Insurance” suggests that expenses related to travel only are covered but travel insurance covers more than that. It also covers your hospitalisation while you are abroad which is important because the health insurance purchased by you in India generally covers your hospitalisation in India only. Some of the countries make the purchase of travel insurance a precondition before the issuance of a visa. Looking at the cost of medical treatments in some developed countries, it is a prerequisite for you to buy adequate travel insurance to safeguard yourself against a big hole in your pocket. Generally, travel insurance covers your loss of checked-in baggage, the cost of treatment, and hospitalisation abroad. Though most of the insurers do not cover your pre-existing disease a few of the insurers cover the treatment in case of life-threatening diseases. This also covers loss suffered due to delay or cancellation of your flights. It also covers any emergency arising out of delay or cancellation of flights.How do we decide the sum assured?Since international travel insurance is supposed to cover majorly your hospitalisation, you should take into account the cost of hospitalisation in the country you are travelling to.Moreover, as it covers the loss of your checked-in luggage, you should take into account the value of your valuable belongings like your camera, laptop, etc. which you are carrying with you. You also need to factor in the cost of ticketing as well as hotel stay in case of delay or cancellation of flights.What kind of travel insurance plan one should buy?In case you are a frequent flier, you can buy a Multi-Trip travel insurance that covers you for all future trips taken within a specific period, with the same level of cover. For instance, if you buy an annual multi-trip travel insurance plan, you will be covered for any trips you go on during that year. However, in case your travel is one thing, you should buy travel insurance before undertaking that journey.What Is the premium for travel insurance?The premium of the travel insurance will depend on the period for which you are buying the travel insurance as well as the country you are travelling. Since hospitalisation is the major item that is covered under travel insurance, the premium will depend on the country you are travelling to. Some of the companies offer you cheaper insurance with sub-limits.Exciting news! Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels. Subscribe today by clicking the link and stay updated with the latest financial insights! Click here&nbsp;For domestic travel, you may decide not to buy the insurance in case you are adequately covered under your regular health insurance. You may still decide to cover the two other elements of coverage like loss of baggage and loss due to delay or cancellation of flights but generally nobody buys domestic travel insurance.When should one take it?One should buy travel insurance before one undertakes a trip whether it is a foreign trip or domestic trip. One can buy it online as well if one is comfortable doing it.What type of travel policy should I buy?&nbsp;The travel insurance to buy will depend on the country and period for which you are travelling and thus you will have to compare the premium and features of various insurance companies which provides travel insurance. Since most of the insurance companies provide you with instant quotes based on the data fed, you can check and compare a few insurance company websites to zero on specific products.Keep in mind that selecting the right insurance policy has to be done carefully, since just like regular insurance, travel insurance comes in many options, and there is no one right plan.Balwant Jain is a tax and investment expert and can be reached at jainbalwant@gmail.com and on @jainbalwant on Twitter.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts, and not of Mint.

Protection from cancer treatment costs demands an additional health insurance cover above standard health insurance.Also Read: Focus on essential features when choosing health insurance, says Vivek ChaturvediBy 2050, over 35 million new cancer cases are expected to be reported across the world. According to the World Health Organisation’s latest report, the number of new cancer cases will increase by a massive 77 per cent in 2050 from the estimated 20 million cases in 2022. In India, 14.3 lakh new cancer cases and 9.16 lakh deaths were reported in 2022.On World Cancer Day, know about the insurance options that can help in covering cancer treatment expenses.&nbsp;Also Read: The Role of Cancer Insurance in Cancer Prevention and Early DetectionIs standard health insurance enough for cancer treatment expenses?&nbsp;A large number of standard health insurance cover expenses that are related to cancer treatment like hospitalisation expenses. People can also opt for riders with their standard health insurance cover for cancer treatment. However, standard health insurance might not cover all the expenses of treatment.Also Read: 9.3 lakh lives lost to cancer in India, urging the need for comprehensive health insuranceCancer insuranceThere is also another option of opting for cancer-specific health insurance which covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed with cancer.“A cancer-specific insurance is focused on expenses directly associated with cancer, covering diagnosis, treatment, hospitalisation, surgery, and medication costs. It provides coverage at both early and advanced stages of cancer,” explains Business Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com, Siddharth Singhal.Critical illness insuranceOne of the ways to guard against the financial burden of cancer treatment is to opt for a critical illness insurance plan. Such plans offer fixed benefits that provide coverage for a specific list of illnesses, including cancer, heart attack, kidney failure, liver disorders, etc.Also Read: Here’s why doctors should consider professional indemnity insurance“A critical illness cover acts as a top–up to your basic health insurance, providing a lump sum payment upon the diagnosis of critical illnesses like cancer, heart attack, organ failure, paralysis, etc. In contrast to typical health insurance plans, which reimburse based on hospital bills, critical illness coverage guarantees a fixed sum, regardless of treatment costs,” noted Singhal.Critical illness plan or cancer insurance?A critical insurance plan provides cover for nearly 30 life-threatening illnesses, including cancer.Underlining the benefit of a critical insurance plan, Singhal adds that it “offers a more versatile solution for individuals seeking comprehensive protection against various serious health conditions”.However, a cancer plan is relevant for a person with a family history, as it covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed.“A cancer plan is more relevant if you have a family history. If not, it is better to first buy a critical illness plan. Regular health plans also cover cancer, so the principal advantage with an indemnity cancer plan is that OPD expenses are covered and a sum assured is set aside for cancer,” Co-Founder SecureNow, Abhishek Bondia earlier told Mint.Things to look into while opting for critical illness insuranceSum Insured: It is important to be mindful of the sum insured in illness insurance coverage. In most of the life-threatening illnesses, the associated treatment cost can soar to  ₹30-40 lakhs. Opting for a policy with a coverage range of  ₹50 lakh to 1 crore becomes vital to ensure adequate financial protection, according to Siddharth Singhal.Diseases covered: The number of critical illnesses covered varies in different plans. “Hence, policyholders should verify that their policy extends coverage to at least 30 critical illnesses and has a survival period requirement of 7-15 days to avail of the benefits,” said Singhal.In addition to this, it is equally important to compare and analyse various cancer coverage plans online for an informed decision. Moreover, it is a must to have a better understanding of the exclusions in the policy.", "Published_Date": "2024-02-04T19:57:56+05:30"},

A couple of years from now, it is more than likely that we will be flying to these destinations. For now, we certainly hope to operate to multiple international destinations by the end of this summer season,” founder and chief executive officer Vinay Dube said at a roundtable discussion.Akasa Air, which commenced flight operations in India in August 2022, is slated to operate its maiden international flight on 28 March from Mumbai to Doha. The airline had operated its first domestic flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad.While there are challenges in availability of flying rights for cities such as Dubai and Sharjah, there is also a big pool of options for the airline such as Abu Dhabi, Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam, and Bahrain to add international destinations going forward, Dube said.\"It is just the beginning. Our planes have the capability to fly non-stop to east coast of Africa from the North, to Hong Kong from Bengaluru, Kolkata etc. Based on the international demand that we foresee coming out of India, we will be able to get to those levels in 2-3 years in international segment, which (other) airlines took over 15 years to get in India,” Dube added.The airline, which has a 4.5% market share in domestic segment, is also bullish on the growth story of the Indian air travel market in both domestic and international segments.\"March used to be a seasonally-weak quarter, but the kind of demand we are seeing play out in India and for markets to and from India is fantastic. We are going to see this amazing demand for the next 10 years. I see demand outpacing capacity for the next 10 years,” Dube said.The airline operates a fleet of 24 Boeing B737 MAX aircraft in India. In January, Akasa had placed a $20-billion order for an additional 150 narrow-body Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The latest order takes the airline’s cumulative order book to 226 planes with the anticipated delivery of the rest of the order over the next eight years through 2032.In January, the airline, along with Air India Express and SpiceJet, was asked by civil aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation to carry out a one-time inspection of the emergency exits on all Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft after an incident with US carrier Alaska airlines on a Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft in which a door plug or a structure installed to replace an optional emergency exit door blew out. The DGCA had then informed that the checks were “satisfactorily performed.”“Nobody in aviation can put too much of an effort on safety. We are happy with increased and renewed focus of Boeing, Federal Aviation Administration, our regulator (DGCA), and we think this is a good thing. What we are flying today is safe. The issues are not just with another variant, it is with a modification of another variant. We are flying a standard aircraft,” Dube said.The airline is also confident of smooth implementation of new flight duty time limitations norms which increase weekly rest periods for flight crew or pilots to 48 hours per week from the previous 36 hours. Airlines such as Air India and IndiGo had written to DGCA for a one-year postponement of the June deadline citing that these norms could result in shortage of pilots.“At Akasa, we plan for the future. We have 700 pilots and a fleet of 24 aircraft. When the switchover happens, you are not going to see any change in reliability from Akasa,” he said. He added that the airline has plans to launch a cadet programme for pilots in the near future.“India continues to have a massive pipeline of unemployed commercial pilot licence holders, my message to them is with increased demand and planes coming, there is a spot for you. But, there will be a need (of cadet programme) in the coming months,” he added.", "Published_Date": "2024-03-21T20:06:41+05:30"},

You are set to return home on a certain date, but due to some unavoidable reasons, you now need to return earlier. LiveMint talked to experts to understand under what circumstances a person who has taken travel insurance would be allowed to get a full refund of their return tickets.According to Manas Kapoor, business head of Travel Insurance at Policybazaar.com, travellers can get a full refund in the case of a medical emergency. This is also true if any one of the immediate family members falls sick on the trip or dies.Sandeep Bajaj, advocate at the Supreme Court of India, added, “The definition as to what falls under health emergency varies with the policies, but it generally covers sudden, unforeseen illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention that necessitates changing travel plans.”Kapoor said that the definition of immediate family varies with different insurers, “but majorly, siblings, spouse, father, mother, all those are considered family across all insurance.”Experts suggested that in the case of a medical emergency, a traveller is required to submit all the proofs to get a refund.“In such an event, the passenger must preserve and collate all the relevant documents necessary to prove the existence of a medical emergency,” said Vipul Jai, partner at PSL Advocates &amp; Solicitors.Kapoor explained that these documents may include proofs like admission to a hospital and a doctor’s advice on returning.&nbsp;According to Bajaj, there are some other cases when an airline may have to fully refund a traveller.“In cases where the airline cancels a flight due to bad weather, mechanical issues, or staffing problems or if there is a significant rescheduling in the flight timings, the passengers are entitled to get a full refund regardless of the reason for cancellation,” Bajaj said.However, in these cases, according to the rules of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), an airline is bound to provide a traveller with an alternative at no additional cost. If one does not accept it, they are not bound to get any compensation.“One is not entitled to any compensation or refund in case you don’t accept alternative travel arrangements or if the cancellation occurs due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the airline, like any force majeure events like civil war, natural disasters, security risks, government regulations etc,” said Sneha Bhogle Kale, partner at Accord Juris LLP.The compensation or refund is covered under Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR), Section-3, Series-M, Part-IV of the DGCA rules.", "Published_Date": "2024-03-14T14:44:04+05:30"},

A key component of financial planning is choosing the right insurance. Unfortunately, many people mistakenly believe that insurance is primarily for tax savings and prioritize the tax benefits when selecting a policy, but this is not the correct approach.While tax benefits can be an attractive advantage, they should not be the main motivation for purchasing insurance. Here’s why:Insurance: Your financial security blanketConsider insurance as a financial safety net for both you and your family. It offers vital protection against unexpected events that could impact your finances. Here are some primary benefits that extend beyond mere tax savings:Security against life’s unpredictability: Life insurance offers a financial safety net for your loved ones in the event of your premature passing. Health insurance protects you from substantial medical expenses in the event of illness or accidents.Financial stability during challenging times: Disability insurance can compensate for your lost income if you’re unable to work due to a disability. Property insurance safeguards you against financial losses resulting from fire, theft, or natural disasters.Peace of mind: Having the assurance that you and your family are financially protected in emergencies offers priceless peace of mind. It allows you to live life without constantly being preoccupied with “what ifs”.Focus on needs rather than tax benefitsWhen selecting an insurance policy, prioritize your needs and future objectives over the tax advantages. While tax benefits can be a pleasant addition, they shouldn’t be the primary motivation behind your insurance decisions. Here’s what you should take into account:Life stage and responsibilities: A young person may opt for term life insurance for essential coverage, whereas someone with family responsibilities might require a whole life policy with a savings element.Risk tolerance: If you’re risk-averse, contemplate comprehensive coverage plans. If you’re at ease with some risk, you may opt for plans with higher deductibles to enjoy lower premiums.Financial goals: Consider your long-term financial objectives, such as retirement planning or funding your child’s education. Some insurance plans can be tailored to assist you in reaching these goals.Essential checksWhen choosing an insurance policy, prioritize your genuine needs and align it with your future goals, rather than solely focusing on the tax benefit. Here are some essential factors to consider:Your life stage: A young adult may opt for affordable term life insurance, whereas a family might choose whole life insurance with a savings feature.Risk tolerance: If you prefer to avoid risks, you might opt for comprehensive coverage with lower deductibles. However, if you’re comfortable taking on some risk, you could select plans with higher deductibles to enjoy lower premiums.Long-term goals: Consider your long-term objectives, such as retirement or funding your child’s education. Certain insurance plans can be tailored to assist you in reaching these goals.Not everyone fully understands the advantages of insurance or the potential income tax benefits it offers. Insurance should be viewed as a necessity for protection rather than solely for tax advantages. Unfortunately, many individuals lack a deep understanding of personal finance, leading them to mistakenly perceive insurance planning as merely a tax-saving strategy.", "Published_Date": "2024-03-29T09:06:13+05:30"},

Premiums, determined by assessing risk and coverage, determine the insurance cost.3) DeductiblesDeductibles are the amount the policyholder must pay out of pocket before insurance starts.

It's essential to comprehend these limits to prevent being underinsured and experiencing financial strain during a substantial loss.6) Policy Riders and EndorsementsPolicy riders and endorsements provide flexibility, which is crucial in insurance. These optional additions enable policyholders to customize their coverage to better suit their needs, whether by adding protection for specific risks or enhancing existing coverage.7) Claims ProcessSubmitting an insurance claim can feel overwhelming, especially when facing difficult circumstances. Familiarising oneself with the claims process, including documentation needs and resolution timelines, can simplify the process and ensure a smoother experience during challenging times.8) Renewal and CancellationInsurance isn't a one-time thing; it's ongoing.

Earlier, individuals falling in this group were generally kept outside the purview of insurance.&nbsp;ALSO READ |&nbsp;IRDAI omits age restriction on health insurance for 65-year-olds in India: All you need to knowInsurance companies need to introduce health insurance products which take into account the unique needs of demographic groups, particularly senior citizens, students, children, and maternity needs.Waiting period slashedAdditionally, the waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) was cut down from 48 months to 36 months. After the expiry of this period, all diseases will be covered — whether or not they were revealed at the time of buying the policy.Although these new regulations are set to make&nbsp;health insurance more inclusive, there could be more competition, more options and perhaps – higher insurance premiums.Let us understand this in detail. Insurers have traditionally been reluctant to offer insurance to vulnerable groups such as those suffering from chronic diseases and older populations because they are more likely to make a claim.&nbsp;Higher the rate of claim, higher would be the cost for insurance companies. This cost can understandably be compensated by charging a higher insurance premium.We spoke to a few industry experts and some believed that there could be some adjustments in premium.&nbsp;“This might lead to some adjustments in premiums. It's important to remember that health insurance premiums can rise modestly over time to keep pace with medical inflation,” said Bhaskar Nerurkar, Head, Health Administration Team, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.&nbsp;Another expert asserted that the higher cost may get absorbed by the economies of scale.&nbsp;Kapil Mehta, who is an IIT Delhi and IIM Ahmedabad alumnus, and Co-founder of SecureNow Insurance, explained, “Logically the premiums should increase slightly to accommodate these changes but I think that competitive intensity will prevent price increases and the economics of health insurers allow them to absorb these additional costs.”ALSO READ |&nbsp;Insurers to reveal number of insurance claims pending and disposed of, says IRDAI circularSiddharth Singhal, Business Head of Health Insurance at Policybazaar.com, stated “not necessarily” on being asked about the prospect of higher insurance premiums ahead.&nbsp;“Despite the potential rise in claims stemming from the inclusion of individuals with pre-existing conditions and senior citizens in the insured pool, this doesn't necessarily imply an increase in health insurance premiums.

The new rules are to be implemented by 31 July.This, however, is unlikely to ease the plight of policyholders, say industry experts.For one, according to several experts Mint spoke with, hospitals spend much time in processing medical bills and sending them to insurers.“If there is a delay of 12 hours after the treating doctor gives a go-ahead for discharge, hospitals will have taken 8 hours and insurance companies the rest,” said Dr. Prashant Mishra, a Mumbai-based cardiac surgeon.The other significant challenge arises when insurance companies seek additional information from hospitals.“The tariffs for many surgeries are fixed in packages. But disputes arise on what is covered or not in the package. (Insurance firms) disallow certain billing and negotiate rates,” said Dr. G. Anil Krishna, chairman and managing director at Medicover Hospitals.“So far as cashless pre-approval is concerned, (insurers) tend to ask for a lot of documents to figure out if an insurance is valid or not. For example, ascertaining if a patient is really a non-smoker and a non-alcoholic as he or she claimed,” he added. “Medical care in India is subsidised but is still unaffordable for many. Finding an ideal solution is difficult.”Dr. S. Prakash, MD and CEO-designate at Galaxy Health and Allied Insurance, offered a counter. “Delays arise from both insurer-related issues and hospital-related issues, such as hospitals not adhering to all insurance provider requirements.”There might, however, be a solution or two in the near future.A digital futureThe Union health ministry is holding discussions to establish a National Health Claim Exchange (NHCX), an online platform comprising stakeholders including hospitals, insurance companies, and third-party administrators (or TPAs, which are intermediaries between insurers and policyholders).The exchange would enable sharing of claims information digitally, allowing for faster processing. NHCX will create a standard interface to be followed by all participants, but would require patients to give their consent for sharing their health history for it to be effective.They can do this by creating an Ayushman Bharat Health Account and uploading their health history. ABHA is a digital health card issued by the National Health Authority under India’s flagship health mission.“It is a great idea that will improve the turnaround time and reduce the cost from all ends if all stakeholders adopt,” said Narendra Bharindwal, vice president, Insurance Brokers Association of India. “The challenge is hospitals are unregulated. We have to see how many of them join the platform.”Apollo Hospitals, Sterling Hospitals and Manipal Hospital did not immediately reply to emails seeking comments.Also read |&nbsp;Irdai’s policy rollback: How it affects insurance surrendersThe National Health Claim Exchange, apart, insure-tech companies could help reduce manual processing at hospitals and insurance companies, effectively bringing down the time taken to decide on a claim.Insure-tech companies can play a crucial role in shortening the claims journey via automation, said Sumit Ramani, actuary and co-founder at&nbsp;ProtectMeWell.com. For example, while extracting information from a medical document and converting it into medical codes requires experts, the process is increasingly getting automated using artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, he added.“Once the information is converted into medical codes, it would need to be compared to the benefits covered under the policy to identify payable claims,” said Ramani. “Equally running predefined rules to curb fraud, wastage, and abuse becomes easier on standardised data, thus increasing confidence, turnaround time, and accuracy of claims processed.”The standardisation imperativeThe insurance industry, as well as the medical sector in general, is awaiting the establishment of a health regulator that can standardise treatment costs and processes across hospitals.“Standardising tariffs across the industry can help in reducing turnaround time well below 3 hours even in complex billing where to-and-fro happens,” said Bhaskar Nerurkar, head-health administration team, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.“We take about 30 minutes on average in cashless pre-approvals and about 47 minutes after receiving bills from the hospital,” he added. “In cases where the process takes more than 3 hours, the company will take a favourable decision for the customer.”Also read |&nbsp;New health insurance regulator may arrive faster than we thoughtThere are two types of hospitalisation—planned and emergency. Most planned hospitalisations do not require much time for insurance approvals.“Typically, 80% of the cases with planned hospitalisation do not face delays after insurance companies receive the billing,” said Bharindwal of the Insurance Brokers Association of India. “But there could be a delay in the rest of the cases where additional information from hospitals are required.”Irdai also recently allowed customers the option to increase the sum insured or opt for a no-claim discount on the premium at the time of renewal. Presently, only the former is offered.A customer having multiple health insurance policies can decide the order in which they want to make a claim, said Mahavir Chopra, co-founder of insurance platform&nbsp;Beshak.org. “Insurance companies will have to coordinate with each other, not policyholders.”Also read |&nbsp;Insurance reforms in first 100 days agenda of BJP government if voted back", "Published_Date": "2024-06-01T07:00:15+05:30"},

Here are 6 key tips | Mint", "Author": "Pankaj Nawani", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/pankaj-nawani", "Content": "In a country as diverse and populous as India, ensuring the well-being of one's family is paramount. Health insurance has become a necessity today, providing a safety net against medical inflation. Interestingly, over 400 million people still have zero access to health insurance in the country.With numerous health insurance plans available, choosing the right one for your family can be a daunting task. Here are some crucial considerations to make an informed decision.Assess your family’s needsEvery family is unique, with specific health requirements. The first step in choosing the right health insurance plan is to assess these needs.Age: Younger families might prioritise maternity and paediatric care, while older families might focus on coverage for chronic and critical illnesses.Medical History: If your family has a history of specific ailments, ensure the policy covers those conditions adequately.Coverage and benefitsHealth insurance plans offer diverse coverage options. It’s essential to understand what each plan covers and what it does not.Hospitalisation: Ensure the plan covers hospitalisation expenses, including room rent, ICU charges, and surgery costs.Pre and Post Hospitalisation: Good plans cover medical expenses incurred before and after hospitalisation for a specified number of days.Day Care Procedures: With advancements in medical technology, many treatments do not require overnight hospitalisation. Check if the plan covers such procedures.Maternity Benefits: For young couples planning a family, look for plans that cover prenatal and postnatal expenses, delivery charges, and newborn care.Critical Illness Cover: Some plans offer specific coverage for critical illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and kidney failure. This can be a vital add-on.Network hospitalsThe insurer’s network of hospitals is a crucial factor. Ensure that the insurance provider has a wide network of hospitals, especially those close to your residence and work.Cashless Facility: A good network of hospitals offering cashless treatment can be a huge relief during medical emergencies.Quality of Hospitals: Research the hospitals included in the network for their quality of care, facilities, and reputation.Claim processA smooth and hassle-free claim process is essential for peace of mind during medical emergencies.Claim Settlement Ratio: Check the insurer’s claim settlement ratio, which indicates the number of claims settled against the number of claims received.Claim Processing Time: Opt for insurers with a quick and efficient claim processing system.Customer Reviews: Online reviews and testimonials can provide insights into the experiences of other policyholders with the insurer’s claim process.Policy premiums and sub-limitsWhile it is essential to choose a plan that offers comprehensive coverage, it should also be affordable.Premium Amount: Compare premiums for similar coverage across different insurers to ensure you are getting the best deal.Sub-limits: Be aware of sub-limits on room rent, specific treatments, and other expenses. High sub-limits can lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses during claims.No Claim Bonus: Some insurers offer a no-claim bonus, which increases your sum insured for every claim-free year without raising your premium.Additional benefitsLook for additional benefits that can add value to your health insurance plan.Wellness Programs: Some insurers offer wellness programs that include health check-ups, fitness memberships, and preventive care.Telemedicine: With the rise of telemedicine, having access to virtual consultations can be highly convenient.In conclusion, by assessing your family’s needs, understanding the coverage and benefits, checking the network hospitals, evaluating the claim process, comparing premiums and sub-limits, and looking for additional benefits, you can make an informed decision. Remember, the right health insurance plan is not just about affordability; it’s about providing comprehensive coverage that ensures your family’s well-being.Pankaj Nawani, CEO of CarePal Secure&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T14:49:12+05:30"},

The qualification scenario in Group 1 of the T20 World Cup has become very interesting as Afghanistan are now firmly in contention to reach their first ever T20 World Cup semi-final, while Australia could be knocked out soon enough.Asked to bat first, Afghanistan posted a total of 148 runs from their allotted 20 overs, with some key contributions from openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran. In reply, Afghanistan's bowlers kept things tight from the start, taking the first three wickets in the powerplay. A counter-attacking innings from Glenn Maxwell caused some concern for Afghanistan, but a 4-fer from Gulbadin Naib ensured there was no fight left in the match.T20 World Cup qualification scenarioTeam India are now on top of the Group 1 points table with 2 points and a net run rate of +2.425. Australia remain in second place with a superior net run-rate of 0.223, while Afghanistan are third with a net run-rate of +0.650.In this context, the clash between Australia and India, scheduled for Monday, has gained renewed momentum. For the Men in Blue, it is fairly straightforward - win the game against Australia and go through to the semi-finals, but the result may not have much impact on their semi-final prospects unless they suffer a huge defeat.Not only do the Australians need to beat India on Monday, but they also have to depend on Bangladesh to beat Afghanistan in the final Super 8 match of Group 1.Afghanistan, on the other hand, need India to beat Australia and then win the Bangladesh game to book their place in the semi-finals for the first time. Even if India lose their last game, Afghanistan can still make it to the semi-finals by beating Bangladesh by a huge margin.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-23T13:01:51+05:30"},

The study found microplastic pollution in every sample tested.The research, titled ‘Microplastic presence in dog and human testis and its potential association with sperm count and weights of testis and epididymis', involved studying dissolved tissue samples to analyse the remaining plastics.The study, conducted by researchers at the University of New Mexico in the United States, involved testing 23 human and 47 dog testes. It was published on May 15 in the Toxicological Sciences journal.Xiaozhong Yu, one of the researchers and authors of the study and a professor at the University of New Mexico, told The Guardian that he was surprised by the findings. “At the beginning, I doubted whether microplastics could penetrate the reproductive system. When I first received the results for dogs, I was surprised. I was even more surprised when I received the results for humans.”Impact on Sperm CountThe samples were from the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, which routinely collected human testes. The samples were analysed after a seven-year storage period. The human testicles were preserved, so their sperm counts could not be measured. However, the dog testes showed lower sperm counts in samples with higher PVC contamination, per the report.The study, thus, indicated a “possible link” between microplastics and reduced sperm counts while noting that further research is needed to confirm this theory.On the likely impact on sperm count, Professor Yu said, “PVC can release a lot of chemicals that interfere with spermatogenesis, and it contains chemicals that cause endocrine disruption.”Notably, sperm counts in men have been decreasing for decades, with chemical pollution, including pesticides, often blamed. However, microplastics have recently been detected in human blood, placentas, and breast milk, suggesting widespread contamination. While the health impacts are not fully understood, lab studies have shown microplastics can damage human cells.Environmental ImpactThe study noted that microplastics are ubiquitous, found from Mount Everest’s peak to the ocean's depths, and people ingest and inhale these particles daily. These microplastics may then lodge in tissues and cause inflammation or chemicals in the plastics might harm them. In March, doctors also linked microscopic plastics in blood vessels to higher risks of stroke, heart attack, and early death, the report said.What The Study FoundHuman testicles contained nearly three times the plastic concentration found in dog testes: 330 micrograms per gram of tissue versus 123 micrograms.Polyethylene, used in plastic bags and bottles, was the most common microplastic found, followed by PVC.The researchers noted that the widespread presence of microplastics and nanoplastics raised concerns about their impact on human reproductive health. They added that PVC releases chemicals that disrupt spermatogenesis and cause endocrine disruption.However, they added that limited research exists on microplastics within the human reproductive system and its effect on sperm quality.Notably, a smaller 2023 study in China also detected microplastics in six human testes and 30 semen samples. Recent mouse studies have also shown that microplastics can reduce sperm count and cause abnormalities and hormone disruptions.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-21T09:07:45+05:30"},

So he engineers himself to have new passions. One moment he is pushing the boundaries of higher mathematics; the next he is writing operas. “He’d even been interested in the Elysians [the afterlife], once. No longer. He preferred to think about table legs.” Peer’s fickleness relates to a deeper point. When technology has solved humanity’s deepest problems, what is left to do?That is one question considered in a new publication by Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, whose last book argued that humanity faced a one-in-six chance of being wiped out in the next 100 years, perhaps owing to the development of dangerous forms of artificial intelligence (AI). In Mr Bostrom’s latest book, “Deep Utopia”, he considers a rather different outcome. What happens if AI goes extraordinarily well? Under one scenario Mr Bostrom contemplates, the technology progresses to the point at which it can do all economically valuable work at near-zero cost. Under a yet more radical scenario, even tasks that you might think would be reserved for humans, such as parenting, can be done better by AI. This may sound more dystopian than utopian, but Mr Bostrom argues otherwise.Start with the first scenario, which Mr Bostrom labels a “post-scarcity” utopia. In such a world, the need for work would be reduced. Almost a century ago John Maynard Keynes wrote an essay entitled “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren”, which predicted that 100 years into the future his wealthy descendants would need to work for only 15 hours a week. This has not quite come to pass, but working time has fallen greatly. In the rich world average weekly working hours have dropped from more than 60 in the late 19th century to fewer than 40 today. The typical American spends a third of their waking hours on leisure activities and sports. In the future, they may wish to spend their time on things beyond humanity’s current conception. As Mr Bostrom writes, when aided by powerful tech, “the space of possible-for-us experiences extends far beyond those that are accessible to us with our present unoptimised brains.”Yet Mr Bostrom’s label of a “post-scarcity” utopia might be slightly misleading: the economic explosion caused by superintelligence would still be limited by physical resources, most notably land. Although space exploration may hugely increase the building space available, it will not make it infinite. There are also intermediate worlds where humans develop powerful new forms of intelligence, but do not become space-faring. In such worlds, wealth may be fantastic, but lots of it could be absorbed by housing—much as is the case in rich countries today.“Positional goods”, which boost the status of their owners, are also still likely to exist and are, by their nature, scarce. Even if AIs surpass humans in art, intellect, music and sport, humans will probably continue to derive value from surpassing their fellow humans, for example by having tickets to the hottest events. In 1977 Fred Hirsch, an economist, argued in “The Social Limits to Growth” that, as wealth increases, a greater fraction of human desire consists of positional goods. Time spent competing goes up, the price of such goods increases and so their share of GDP rises. This pattern may continue in an AI utopia.Mr Bostrom notes some types of competition are a failure of co-ordination: if everyone agrees to stop competing, they would have time for other, better things, which could further boost growth. Yet some types of competition, such as sport, have intrinsic value, and are worth preserving. (Humans may also have nothing better to do.) Interest in chess has grown since IBM’s Deep Blue first defeated Garry Kasparov, then world champion, in 1997. An entire industry has emerged around e-sports, where computers can comfortably defeat humans. Their revenues are expected to grow at a 20% annual rate over the next decade, reaching nearly $11bn by 2032. Several groups in society today give us a sense of how future humans might spend their time. Aristocrats and bohemians enjoy the arts. Monastics live within themselves. Athletes spend their lives on sport. The retired dabble in all these pursuits.Everyone’s early retirementWon’t tasks such as parenting remain the refuge of humans? Mr Bostrom is not so sure. He argues that beyond the post-scarcity world lies a “post-instrumental” one, in which AIs would become superhuman at child care, too. Keynes himself wrote that “there is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy…To judge from the behaviour and the achievements of the wealthy classes today in any quarter of the world, the outlook is very depressing!” The Bible puts it more succinctly: “idle hands are the devil’s workshop.”These dynamics suggest a “paradox of progress”. Although most humans want a better world, if tech becomes too advanced, they may lose purpose. Mr Bostrom argues that most people would still enjoy activities that have intrinsic value, such as eating tasty food. Utopians, believing life had become too easy, might decide to challenge themselves, perhaps by colonising a new planet to try to re-engineer civilisation from scratch. At some point, however, even such adventures might cease to feel worthwhile. It is an open question how long humans would be happy hopping between passions, as Peer does in “Permutation City”. Economists have long believed that humans have “unlimited wants and desires”, suggesting there are endless variations on things people would like to consume. With the arrival of an AI utopia, this would be put to the test. Quite a lot would ride on the result.For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics,&nbsp;finance and markets, sign up to&nbsp;Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.© 2024, The Economist Newspaper Limited.

Even as Nvidia shareholders and its chief executive rejoiced, analysts and watchers of the company claimed the future may not be so easy. Mint explains:What explains Nvidia’s rise to the top table?Nvidia’s rise to the top was drastic—fuelling its sharp uptick from a mid-tier tech company to one of the biggest in the world in less than two years. At the heart of this growth is artificial intelligence (AI)—as OpenAI’s ChatGPT became popular, Nvidia’s graphics processing unit (GPU) chips, once known only among gamers, took the spotlight. The biggest enterprises globally made a beeline for its chips, which today have a waitlist that runs into years. Nvidia’s GPU technology supremacy also allowed it to control prices, placing it at the right place at the right time to catch the biggest AI boom yet.&nbsp;Also read: Nvidia’s new sales booster: The global push for domestic AI championsIs it comfortable or under threat already?Not under threat, but it is certainly looking over its shoulders. CEO Jensen Huang in March unveiled its largest and most capable GPU chip—called Blackwell. The company is also looking at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), its chipmaking partner, to help ramp up production capacity. But, it can’t accelerate as fast as it needs to—around the world, demand for AI deployments across enterprises, data centres and researchers has skyrocketed. This is seeing multiple brands come to the fore as rivals, while talks have already begun on reducing generative AI’s dependence on the heavy computing power of GPUs.Who are Nvidia’s biggest rivals?Intel and AMD. Intel’s history and expertise in making chips led it to announce Gaudi-3, a dedicated AI chip taking on Nvidia’s in-demand H100. The other rival is AMD’s MI300X GPU, which is ramping up output and enterprise uptake. Industry observers say even if Nvidia claims superior performance, firms are likely to prioritise availability over performance.&nbsp;Also read: GPUs Transformed AI. Now They’re Here For Quantum.Is Big Tech also affecting Nvidia?Yes. Nvidia’s biggest customers include Google parent Alphabet, e-commerce behemoth Amazon, social media giant Meta Platforms, and tech conglomerate Microsoft. Industry estimates peg as much as 40% of Nvidia’s sales to be accounted for one of these four. Alarmingly for Nvidia, each of these firms has invested in its own AI chip to reduce reliance on Nvidia. If this plays out, Nvidia’s power may diminish and affect its market cap. Its sales, however, may not immediately decline thanks to vast troves of pending orders.Is any of this of concern to India?Investment platform Fisdom estimates Indian shareholder exposure of over  ₹400 crore to Nvidia through mutual funds—a drop in the company’s market cap and share prices can affect those that have bet on tech-driven funds. However, for Nvidia, India is a small market—less than 1% of its global revenue is generated in India. Due to India’s stature as a growing economy, Huang would want to maintain good relations.

For him, the “quick wins” were the key.“There's lots of data, technology was in place, but getting the data together, putting the team together and getting the confidence of the leadership that the data science and AI can bring about value or the business outcome, we started with that,” said Ostwal.The former Accenture manager said his team then looked to scale data infrastructure and parallelly looked to build a team that could aid in “productionising” the data, be it structured or unstructured data, so that the digital transformation journey did not slow.From productionising of data for financial services to producing glass containers carrying vodka and perfumes, the ball tagged “digital” and “AI” at the Mint Digital Innovation Summit, rolled to Sudip Mazumder, who is the global chief digital &amp; information officer of PGP Glass, a Mumbai-headquartered glass packaging company.AI designing productsMazumder, representing the manufacturing industry, spoke about AI’s use in designing bottles. He used AI to design a bottle shaped like a stiletto, which is a shoe with high heels made popular in 18th century France, after drawing inspiration from renowned Barcelona-based fashion and fragrance brand Carolina Herrera’s perfume named “Good Girl.”“The way it (AI) is creating the design concept, I'm totally amazed and I am talking about my level. I am not talking about Open AI or Microsoft or Gemini,” said Mazumder.&nbsp;On the skill availability to undertake AI deployment, Basrur and Sushil Ostwal agreed on the importance of prompt engineering.“Every company must train their workforce in AI and Gen AI, and must begin with prompt engineering because that is the starting piece, I would say,” said Ostwal.Basrur also pointed at the importance of getting a “human in the loop” and a human’s level of attention before the final work goes through.While keeping humans at the fore was a point raised, Mazumder threw light on the churn amongst those specialised in AI and Gen AI functions.“This is a reality today that we are facing. Every time I am training new employees on AI and Gen AI, 33% of those new guys after one year have vanished,” said Mazumder, adding that these employees go where demand for small language models is high.The threat permeated to cybersecurity as well. On this front, Ostwal said that companies are putting safeguards in place to protect their systems from breaches and violations.The panel discussion came round circle with all four panelists expressing scope for AI and Gen AI.Ravi on the online gaming front said that AI brought about many possibilities to his team in keeping counterfeit customer requests in check and also to understand patterns of the game while recognising unfair practices.Mazumder on the other hand, expressed scope for AI and Gen AI-led modernisation in the robotics field.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-24T22:27:46+05:30"},

We see these are being replaced with electric machinery in terms of boom lifts, scissor lifts etc,\" Gandhe told Mint in an interview. Close to 40% of Dana India's production in India is exported for global trucks and off-highway equipment markets. Nearly 10% of these exports cater to the electrification of these segments, he said.Also read: Maruti Suzuki may revamp small car portfolio“We are expecting our EV business to be at least 20% of our total business in India in the next 3 to 5 years,\" Gandhe said, adding that the growth will be driven by fulfilment of its OEM clients' electric bus orders, as well as rapid electrification of the off-highway market. Further, growth in electrification of the three-wheeler and high-performance motorcycle segment is also expected to help Dana grow its EV business.The company's electric vehicles business currently accounts for 5% of its overall turnover.Dana India says it accounts for about 60% of India's electric bus and truck market in terms of the major components it supplies to commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).Also read: We challenge OEMs to invest in India, compete with us: M&amp;M's Anish ShahIn the off-highway segment, the level of electrification currently varies with different applications. However, many OEMs are making significant investments to electrify their vehicles quickly, Gandhe explained. According to him, industries like construction and mining often operate within relatively short distances of a few meters, and can easily access charging points within their work locations.Growth Prospects“For example, electrifying mining vehicles would eliminate the emissions that accumulate within confined spaces, improving the working environment. Similarly, construction vehicles such as cement haulers and various types of lifts only need to travel short distances daily, making them ideal candidates for electrification. Additionally, in-plant equipment like forklifts are also expected to transition to electric power, given the benefits of lower operational costs and emissions\", Gandhe explained.Also read: Heat waves, high base take toll on car sales in May\"Electrification in the off-highway segment is pretty small right now, as everybody's developing products, some of which have started coming into the market already. You will see a significant acceleration to this electrification - I would say right now it may not be even in the 1-2% range, but you would see that the growth will be substantial – it can easily go to 10% in the next five years, and even more if the government extends subsidy support”, he said.“The customers and actual utilization patterns of the vehicles will drive this,” he added. “For example, mining. You may have regulation, but more than regulation, it's the mining companies which have to decide how much they care for their people,\" he said.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-09T15:12:26+05:30"},

The Korean automaker has now set its sights on a revamped edition of the Alcazar, positioned as a spacious 7-seater variant akin to the Creta.While specifics regarding the launch timeline of the Alcazar facelift remain undisclosed, a report from HT Auto speculates its debut could precede year-end. The forthcoming 2024 Hyundai Alcazar is poised to feature a completely redesigned front fascia, boasting a distinctive grille, vertically stacked headlights adorned with LED Daytime Running Lamps, and an integrated light bar. These enhancements aim to distinguish the Alcazar from its Creta counterpart while maintaining a cohesive design language.Reportedly, the sleek 18-inch alloy wheels are expected to grace the vehicle's profile, complementing its dynamic aesthetic. At the rear, new LED tail lamps and a refined light bar underscore the model's modernity and sophistication. Notably, Hyundai has confirmed that an N-Line variant of the Alcazar will not be offered, focusing instead on optimizing the model's core features and performance.Inside the cabin, similarities with the Creta are expected, with the possibility of upgraded materials and a configuration that includes captain seats for enhanced comfort, complete with a central console. The Alcazar's variant lineup will showcase unique offerings compared to the Creta, promising a higher standard of features across the board.Under the hood, the 2024 Alcazar is anticipated to mirror the Creta's engine lineup, featuring three powertrain options.

The compact eVX, which has already appeared at various auto shows both in India and internationally, is slated for a launch in India next year.Reportedly, the latest spy photos shared on social media highlight a new design for the eVX’s alloy wheels. Unlike the previous test units which featured 10-spoke alloys, the latest prototype sports a five-spoke alloy wheel design, likely to be 16 inches or larger. Additionally, the eVX continues to feature rear door handles mounted on the C-pillar, reminiscent of the older Swift model, which differs from the handles seen on the initial concept version.Externally, the eVX is expected to boast several features including LED headlights and daytime running lights (DRLs), a LED light bar, a high-mounted stop lamp, a rear spoiler, and a shark-fin antenna. Built on a new electric skateboard platform, the eVX will house a battery expected to be around 60 kWh, promising a driving range of up to 550 kilometers on a single charge.Maruti Suzuki also unveiled the interior of the eVX during a concept showcase last year, revealing a modern and futuristic design equipped with all the latest amenities.The eVX is expected to feature a large touchscreen infotainment system compatible with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a digital instrument panel, wireless charging capabilities, ventilated front seats, automatic climate control, electrically adjustable driver’s seat, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.As Maruti Suzuki inches closer to launching the eVX, these new details underscore the company's commitment to blending innovation with practicality in its bid to capture a share of the electric vehicle market in India.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T17:00:10+05:30"},

Now geopolitics is helping them be even more competitive in the growing EV market.Investors in the companies, which have designs and some ownership in common, have found themselves in the fast lane as a result. Shares of Hyundai Motor have gained 85% since the end of 2022 while those of Kia have more than doubled. Hyundai is Kia’s largest shareholder with a 34% stake. The two companies reported record earnings last year, with both increasing their operating profits by more than 50% from 2022.The U.S. has been the major growth driver for both companies as they have steadily increased their market share. Hyundai and Kia together have more than 10% of the U.S. market, according to Goldman Sachs. Their combined revenue in North America has doubled in the past five years alone. With lucrative sport utility vehicles such as the Tucson and the Santa Fe, Goldman estimates that the U.S. is their most profitable market.Their success in green technology is helping: Nearly 8% of Hyundai’s cars sold in the U.S. last year were EVs. That proportion was even higher at 16% in more EV-friendly Europe. But they have also been offering a more balanced portfolio of products: Around 10% of Hyundai’s cars sold in the U.S. were conventional hybrids.That is especially important as hybrid sales could grow faster in the next few years while consumers sit on the fence for the EV transition. Nomura expects global hybrid sales to grow an average 26% between 2023 and 2026, outpacing the 19% growth in pure EVs. Nomura predicts even faster growth of 34% in the U.S. market.Geopolitics will provide another tailwind as affordable Chinese EVs face obstacles in America. Currently, EVs from the Korean automakers aren’t necessarily eligible for $7,500 tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, but that would change after Hyundai’s $7.6 billion manufacturing plant in Georgia opens later this year.Booming India is becoming another important market for the Korean automakers. Hyundai plans to spin off a minority stake in its Indian unit in what could become the country’s largest-ever initial public offering, raising billions of dollars in the process. The companies have been moving their production capacity from China to India in the past decade—especially as the relationship between China and Korea has deteriorated.Hyundai and Kia collectively are already the second largest automaker in India, with around a fifth of the market. Sales are mostly internal combustion engine vehicles. EVs and hybrids could be the next leg in their growth. EVs only accounted for 2% of the Indian market last year, according to Counterpoint Research, but sales nearly doubled in 2023 and the government said in March that it would cut import duties on some EVs for companies that invest at least $500 million to make their cars there.That may lead to more competition from Chinese EV makers. BYD, for example, sells cars in India. But geopolitics might stymie Chinese players: The Indian government rejected BYD’s proposed $1 billion manufacturing plan last year.That potential doesn’t come at a premium price: Hyundai and Kia both trade at around 5 times forward earnings, below most of their peers. Toyota, for example, fetches 9 times. Investors should at least consider a test drive.Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T18:31:47+05:30"},

One had the logo of Mr Altman’s machine-learning startup, OpenAI. The other bore an emblem for Helion, a nuclear-fusion company that Mr Altman also backs. The entrepreneur is obsessed with both technologies—not just as foot fashion. He believes that the cost of intelligence and the cost of energy will fall in a mutually sustainable way. He calls it a “long and beautiful exponential curve”.Nasty, brutish and short, more like. Talk to utilities and data-centre operators and, though many share Mr Altman’s excitement about artificial intelligence (AI), they are grappling with an energy conundrum on which the future of three big economic shifts partly hinges: the AI revolution; the efforts to electrify swathes of the economy; and the fight against climate change. In a nutshell, “generative” AI, the sort behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has a ravenous appetite for electricity. It has landed, virtually out of the blue, on a global energy system that is already struggling to cope with alternative sources of power demand. As yet it is not clear whether there will be enough clean energy to meet everyone’s needs.At first glance, the solution looks simple. Data centres, such as those that companies like Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft use to supply cloud-computing services, have over the past decade or so accounted for only 1-2% of global energy demand. For years the big-tech “hyperscalers” have harvested ever greater energy efficiencies from their server farms, even as the world’s computing workloads have soared. Moreover, they have invested heavily in clean energy to offset their carbon footprints. In America, electricity providers to the hyperscalers are only too keen to help. They have endured two decades of anaemic electricity demand and are desperate for new sources of growth. In recent earnings calls their bosses have promised tens of billions of dollars in investment over the next five years to pump more power to data centres. Last month one such firm, Talen Energy, sold Amazon a nuclear-powered data centre for $650m. So far, so promising.Generative AI changes the nature of the game, though. Since the days when they were the workhorses of the cryptocurrency boom, graphics-processing units (GPUs), the chips on which models like ChatGPT are trained and run, have been energy addicts. According to Christopher Wellise of Equinix, which rents out data centres, a pre-AI hyperscale server rack uses 10-15 kilowatts (kw) of power. An AI one uses 40-60kw. It is not just computation that gobbles up electricity. Keeping the racks of GPUs cool requires just as much oomph. Moreover, a lot of AI-related energy demand in the past year or so has come from trainers of “foundation” models like GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest offering. Widespread use of these as tools—for research, to make videos, to dress the Pope in Balenciaga—could put more strain on the grid. A search by ChatGPT may consume ten times the electricity of googling.It is early days in the generative-AI boom, so it is too soon to make hard and fast predictions. But informed guesses about the related rise in energy demand are striking. At the top of its range, the International Energy Agency, a global forecaster, says that by 2026 data centres could use twice as much energy as two years ago—and as much as Japan consumes today. It expects data centres to account for a third of new electricity demand in America over the next two years. Rene Haas, chief executive of Arm, a chip-design company, told the Wall Street Journal this week that by the end of the decade AI data centres could consume as much as a quarter of all American electricity, up from 4% or less today.In America, two things further compound the complexities. The first is timing. The rise of generative AI coincides with a booming economy, with power consumption to match. Many power consumers want their energy to be zero-carbon, creating competition for a scarce resource. So do buyers of electric vehicles (EVs), the rise of which may have slowed but has not stopped. The second is the challenge of expanding the grid. Despite support from the White House, it is not easy for utilities to build new renewable capacity quickly. They suffer from supply-chain problems; by some accounts it takes three years to deliver a transformer, up from less than a year previously. Interest rates have pushed up the cost of wind and solar projects, making them harder to fund. Building new transmission lines is fiendishly tough.No doubt there will be creative thinking. The obvious solution is to make GPUs more energy-efficient. Nvidia, their biggest supplier, says it has already achieved this with its latest generation of AI servers. More efficient chips can, however, simply stimulate more usage. Another option, says Aaron Denman of Bain, a consultancy, is for the hyperscalers to use their deep pockets to help utilities overcome some of the grid constraints. He says that the real crunch may occur during certain parts of the year, such as unusually hot summer days when Americans switch on their air-conditioners. That means having small power plants on standby. The likelihood, though, is that these will be fuelled by natural gas, undermining the cloud providers’ climate commitments.The nuclear optionIf shortages of renewable energy occur, it will come at a cost. No one knows yet how generative AI will make money. What people do know is that the cost of acquiring GPUs is rocketing. If the energy costs of running them soar, too, it could put the brakes on expansion. In addition, the electrification of the rest of the economy is highly cost-dependent; an AI v EV scramble for clean power would push up prices and serve neither industry well. By all means keep your fingers crossed for Mr Altman’s rose-tinted fusion dream to become reality. But don’t count on it.© 2024, The Economist Newspaper Limited.

OpenAI’s natural-language system creates recipes, writes computer code and parodies literary styles. Its latest iteration can even describe photographs. It has been hailed as a technological breakthrough on a par with the printing press. But it has not taken long for huge flaws to emerge, too. It sometimes “hallucinates” non-facts that it pronounces with perfect confidence, insisting on those falsehoods when queried. It also fails basic logic tests.In other words, ChatGPT is not a general artificial intelligence, an independent thinking machine. It is, in the jargon, a large language model. That means it is very good at predicting what kinds of words tend to follow which others, after being trained on a huge body of text—its developer, OpenAI, does not say exactly from where—and spotting patterns.Amid the hype, it is easy to forget a minor miracle. ChatGPT has aced a problem that long served as a far-off dream for engineers: generating human-like language. Unlike earlier versions of the system, it can go on doing so for paragraphs on end without descending into incoherence. And this achievement’s dimensions are even greater than they seem at first glance. ChatGPT is not only able to generate remarkably realistic English. It is also able to instantly blurt out text in more than 50 languages—the precise number is apparently unknown to the system itself.Asked (in Spanish) how many languages it can speak, ChatGPT replies, vaguely, “more than 50”, explaining that its ability to produce text will depend on how much training data is available for any given language. Then, asked a question in an unannounced switch to Portuguese, it offers up a sketch of your columnist’s biography in that language. Most of it was correct, but it had him studying the wrong subject at the wrong university. The language itself was impeccable.Portuguese is one of the world’s biggest languages. Trying out a smaller language, your columnist probed ChatGPT in Danish, spoken by only about 5.5m people. Danes do much of their online writing in English, so the training data for Danish must be orders of magnitude scarcer than what is available for English, Spanish or Portuguese. ChatGPT’s answers were factually askew but expressed in almost perfect Danish. (A tiny gender-agreement error was the only mistake caught in any of the languages tested.)Indeed, ChatGPT is too modest about its own abilities. On request, it furnishes a list of 51 languages it can work in, including Esperanto, Kannada and Zulu. It declines to say that it can “speak” these languages, but rather “generates text” in them. This is too humble an answer. Addressed in Catalan—a language not on the list—it replies in that language with a cheerful “Yes, I do speak Catalan—what can I help you with?” A few follow-up questions do not trip it up in the slightest, including a query about whether it is merely translating answers first generated in another language into Catalan. This, ChatGPT denies: “I don’t translate from any other language; I look in my database for the best words and phrases to answer your questions.”Who knows if this is true? ChatGPT not only makes things up, but incorrectly answers questions about the very conversation it is having. (It has no “memory”, but rather feeds the last few thousand words of each conversation back into itself as a new prompt. If you have been speaking English for a while it will “forget” that you asked a question in Danish earlier and say that the question was asked in English.) ChatGPT is untrustworthy not just about the world, but even about itself.This should not overshadow the achievement of a model that can effortlessly mimic so many languages, including those with limited training data. Speakers of smaller languages have worried for years about language technologies passing them by. Their justifiable concern had two causes: the lesser incentive for companies to develop products in Icelandic or Maltese, and the relative lack of data to train them.Somehow the developers of ChatGPT seem to have overcome such problems. It is too early to say what good the technology will do, but this alone gives one reason to be optimistic. As machine-learning techniques improve, they may not require the vast resources, in programming time or data, traditionally thought necessary to make sure smaller languages are not overlooked online.© 2024, The Economist Newspaper Limited.

The purple pattern over the planet stopped suddenly when the most energetic particles arrived and overwhelmed the instrument with noise, the US space agency explained in its Instagram post.How Auroras on Earth are different from those occurring on Mars?⁣Auroras are colourful lights which are visible when energy particles emanating from solar storms travel down the magnetic field lines of a planet. Auroras visible on Earth and on other planets are different. As Earth planet is shielded by a robust magnetic field, these lights are normally restricted to regions near the poles.Whereas, Mars has lost its internally generated magnetic field in the ancient past. Hence, when the charged particles enter Mars' atmosphere, there’s no protection from the barrage of energetic particles. When charged particles hit the Martian atmosphere, it results in auroras that engulf the entire planet.⁣", "Published_Date": "2024-06-14T15:04:49+05:30"},

The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) recently shared an image of the lumpy astronomical object, which appears like a potato travelling in space. Phobos got its lumpy shape because of its weak gravity. As the gravity was not strong enough to pull the object into a sphere, Phobos got a lumpy shape.“Phobos is the larger of Mars' two moons—but it's still only about 17 x 14 x 11 miles (27 by 22 by 18 kilometers) in diameter. Because Phobos is so small, its gravity isn't strong enough to pull it into a sphere (like Earth's Moon), giving it its lumpy shape,” wrote NASA on X.About Phobos moonMars moons are one of the smallest in the solar system. However, Phobos is comparatively larger than its peer, Deimos. Phobos orbits only 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometres) above the Martian surface and is the only moon to orbit this much close to its planet. Phobos revolves around Mars three times a day, which means you can see this ‘space potato’ three timesa day on Mars' surface. On the contrary, another Mars moon, Deimos, takes nearly 30 hours for each orbit.Phobos heading to collision with MarsPhobos is on a collision course with Mars. However, it may take nearly 50 million years, for the lumpy moon to reach the Read Planet and collide with it. Phobos is nearing the Red Planet at a rate of six feet (1.8 meters) every hundred years. At that rate, the moon will either crash into Mars in 50 million years or break up into a ring.

However, NASA closely monitors a small fraction of asteroids known as potentially hazardous asteroids, which have orbits that could bring them within a certain distance of Earth, posing a potential impact risk.To monitor these celestial bodies, NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) utilizes data from observatories worldwide, including contributions from projects like Pan-STARRS, the Catalina Sky Survey, and NASA's NEOWISE mission. Radar projects such as JPL's Goldstone Solar System Radar Group also play a crucial role in tracking these space rocks.The ongoing monitoring efforts by astronomers, supported significantly by amateur contributions, play a critical role in understanding and monitoring these celestial bodies. This collaborative effort ensures early detection and assessment of any potential impact risks from near-Earth objects.Asteroid 2024 KN1's upcoming close approach provides scientists with another opportunity to study these fascinating objects in our solar system. As technology and observational capabilities continue to advance, our understanding of near-Earth objects and their trajectories improves, enhancing our ability to predict and mitigate any potential future risks.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-22T16:23:24+05:30"},

This development follows the US space agency's decision to take more time to review the spacecraft's technical issues.This time, NASA didn't give any new date for the spacecraft's return flight carrying astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore. The absence of any announcement on the next date has raised questions about the timing of the return of the two astronauts on Boeing.What's causing the delay in Sunita Williams's return spaceflight?Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore's return spaceflight was initially scheduled for June 14, and was later postponed to June 26. However, scientists are now planning for future possibilities of space return due to the station's two planned spacewalks on June 24 and July 2.\"Mission managers are evaluating future return opportunities following the station’s two planned spacewalks on June 24 and July 2,\" Reuters quoted NASA's statement.\"We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.Steve Stich also informed that Starliner is performing well in orbit and more time in space would yield “valuable insight” into system upgrades for future missions.About Boeing Starliner's test flightThe previous two test flights of Boeing Starliners carried out without humans on board encountered five failures of its 28 maneuvering thrusters. In addition to this, there were reports of five leaks of helium gas and a slow-moving propellant valve, according to a Reuters report.What is the next date of return space flight?So far, NASA hasn't announced any other date of Sunita Williams's space flight. There are high chances that it would take longer for her to come back to Earch, as issues with Starliner spacecraft and additional tests run by NASA and Boeing may cause further delay. According to Reuters report, Boeing has invested nearly $1.5 billion in cost overruns. The amount is beyond its $4.5 billion NASA-development contract. The successful completion of the spaceflight would unlock Boeing's journey to become the second company to manufacture spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts with the ISS.

However, the Lok Sabha election results may not necessarily pose a threat to the AAP. The party had won the 2020 and 2015 Delhi Assembly elections with a whopping majority, despite losing the 2019 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls in the national capital.B. Delhi water crisisThe Delhi government has been facing an uphill task in dealing with the water crisis reported in parts of the city amid the sweltering heatwave conditions. This crisis and the political row stemming from it are feared to give rise to an anti-incumbency wave against the AAP government in the city.The city government demanded neighbouring Haryana to release more water, but in vain.

Amid uncertainties, a Congress leader is likely to be appointed ahead of the upcoming Parliament session. This will break the 10-year spell as there has been no Leaders of Opposition in the Lower House since 2014.But who is the Leader of the Opposition? Why wasn't there any Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha since 2014? Why is the Congress likely to get the post? The answer lies in numbers.Who is the Leader of Opposition?The Leader of the Opposition is the Leader of the largest opposition party. The post was not recognised till 1969 when Ram Subhag Singh became the first recognised LoP of the Lok Sabha.The post received statutory recognition through the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977.The Act defines the term ' Leader of the Opposition' as that member of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha who, for the time being, is the Leader of that House of the party in Opposition to the government having the greatest numerical strength and recognised, as such, by the chairman of the Rajya Sabha or the speaker of the Lok Sabha.Who gets the Leader of Opposition post in Lok Sabha?Although several political parties may exist in the Opposition, the post of Leader of the Opposition is said to be taken up by the party that secures one-tenth of the total strength of the Lok Sabha.&nbsp;As per this rule, since the Lok Sabha has 543 members, a political party will need 55 members to appoint a Leader of the Opposition.The Institute of Secretariat Training and Management mentioned in one of its booklet that the recognition of the Leader of Opposition is given by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha – “provided the largest party in opposition have minimum 55 MP in the House”.&nbsp;This institute is managed by the Department of Personnel and Training, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Government of India.However, no such 10 percent rule for the appointment of the Leader of Opposition is mentioned in the Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act.Why didn't Lok Sabha have Leader of Opposition in the last 10 years?Simply because no political party, other than the ruling party, was able to secure the minimum Lok Sabha seats required to nominate a Leader of the Opposition.In the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, the Congress emerged as the second-largest party with 52 seats. This was three short of the requisite numbers. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress, again the second largest party, won 44 Lok Sabha seats — way below the mark.Why Congress will get Leader of Opposition post this time?This time, the Congress emerged as the single larges party in the INDIA bloc (Opposition) by winning 99 Lok Sabha seats — comfortably crossing the 55-member mark needed for a political party to appoint a Leader of the Opposition.NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Thursday that the Congress will decide on the appointment on the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha as it has maximum seats among the INDIA bloc parties in the Lower House of Parliament. \"After the Congress decides, it will need the consent of our (INDIA) bloc,\" he was quoted by PTI as sayin.Who could be the Leader of Opposition in 18th Lok Sabha?Speculations are rife that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi may take up the key post in the 18th Lok Sabha.The Congress Working Committee passed a resolution urging Rahul Gandhi to accept the role as Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha.

Since then, the opposition has waged a war of words and counter-allegations as it raised concerns over the future of lakhs of student put on stake after the alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG 2024 exam.Bihar is among the states where there are allegations of question paper leak in the NEET-UG exam 2024. The Bihar Police is actively probing the case. The Economic Offences Unit of Bihar Police had last month arrested 13 people, including prime suspect Sikandar Yadavendu, in connection with the alleged paper leak in the NEET-UG 2024 exam conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), PTI reported.The NEET rowThe alleged irregularities in this year's NEET-UG 2024 exam came to light after 67 students scored a perfect 720, unprecedented in the NTA's history. Six of them were from a centre in Haryana.Moreover, it was alleged that grace marks contributed to 67 students sharing the top rank. The National Testing Agency (NTA) had earlier said the changes made in NCERT textbooks and grace marks for losing time at the examination centres were some of the reasons behind the students scoring higher marks.How NEET row took a political turnA. Bihar Dy CM alleges Tejashwi Yadav linkOne June 20, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sinha linked the alleged NEET 'paper leak' matter to \"Tejashwi Yadav's personal secretary Pritam Kumar\". He alleged that Kumar got a room booked for Sikander Kumar Yadavendu, one of the accused in the \"paper leak\" case.Sinha claimed that Tejashwi's secretary, Pritam Kumar had called a guest house worker of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to book a room for Yadavendu. He said that the word \"Mantri\" was used for the former Deputy CM Yadav.Sinha also sought a clarification from Tejashwi Yadav regarding whether Pritam Kumar is still his Personal Secretary and who is Sikander Yadavendu.\"When Lalu Prasad Yadav was jailed in Ranchi, Sikander Kumar Yadavendu used to be at Lalu's service. He was a Junior Engineer in the irrigation department. They play with the future of the people. They do scams when they are in power and they try to influence the appointment process,\" Sinha alleged.B. RJD links accused with Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, posts pictureIn retaliation to Sinha's claim, the RJD released an undated picture showing another Bihar's Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, puportedly with co-accused Amit Anand.Tejashwi Yadav's political party captioned the photo, saying, “The main accused in the NEET exam paper leak scam with the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar.”“The so-called powerful minister, who was felicitated by the accused, has deleted all his photos with him from his social media handles. But don't worry, we have them all. Send this to your worried counterpart the other deputy CM,” the party's post read.Mint could not independently verify the charges.In another tweet, the RJD alleged, “The #NEET paper was leaked in the three states governed by BJP , Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana.”How Tejashwi Yadav respondedTejashwi Yadav broke his silence on the allegations made against him and said that the BJP wanted to \"divert the attention\" from the kingpin, so they dragged his name.He said the BJP \"can call the PS or PA anyone for probe.\" He said, “They want to divert the issue from the kingpin...Those who want to drag my name or my PA's name, this will not benefit anyone...”He demanded the NEET exam to be cancelled immediately. \"The engineer who is talked about could be a beneficiary but Amit Anand and Nitish Kumar are the masterminds of the paper leak,\" he added.Steps taken by govt so farOn Saturday, the education ministry notified a seven-member panel headed by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan to ensure transparent, smooth and fair conduct of examinations through the NTA.Also, the NTA Director General, Subodh Kumar Singh, was removed from the post on Saturday. Singh's services were put on a \"compulsory wait\" in Department of Personnel and Training, the government said in a letter. India Trade Promotion Organisation Chairman and MD Pradeep Singh Kharola was assigned additional charge of NTA DG.Amid the alleged irregularities, Joint CSIR-UGC-NET and NEET-PG examination have been postponed. Meanwhile, UGC-NET was cancelled due to the ‘compromised integrity’ of the examination.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-23T06:17:19+05:30"},

Regarding Throor's X post an attempt to “shame other fellow Indians”, BJP leader Rajeev Chandrashekhar wrote, “ Shameless crass politics of shaming other fellow Indians - thats the Congress way, ably demonstrated by this self-titled Global citizen.”\"It was just a few months ago, another of Cong \"global citizens\" Pitroda described Indians as Africans, Chinese, Middle eastern etc. Runs deep in the Cong DNA, this type of superiority complex,\" former union minister added.Chandrashekhar lost to Shashi Tharoor in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram constituency by over 16,077 votes in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Union minister Jitin Prasada called Tharoor's comments an insult to the people of Uttar Pradesh and condemned his pos in strongest words.“I don’t see the humour in running down my state and its people by stereotyping them with such condemnable remarks. Such an insult to UP is deplorable and must be condemned in strongest words,\" wrote Jitin Prasada.Calling ‘An Era of Darkness’ author a “repeated offender”, BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan alleged that Tharoor has earlier insulted the people of northeast by “ridiculing their traditional attire as outlandish.” He also mentioned that “splattering fancy English words does not necessarily mean one is civil and dignified.”\"Seriously, Shashi Tharoor is this the level to which you wish to take this discourse?

Take Eli Lilly’s Alzheimer’s disease treatment donanemab, which a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee on Monday unanimously recommended for approval. That should grease the way for FDA approval.Lilly has spent more than 30 years and $8 billion working on Alzheimer’s treatments. Four clinical trials with another experimental drug had failed. After one pivotal trial in 2016 disappointed, some dismissed Lilly’s strategy of targeting amyloid plaque in the brain—a signature of the disease—and urged the company to abandon its Alzheimer’s drug research.Instead, Lilly learned from earlier trials and made a major bet on donanemab, another anti-amyloid drug. Some patients in earlier trials suffered from other forms of dementia. Advances in brain imaging enabled Lilly to accurately diagnose and screen Alzheimer’s patients for its donanemab trial. Lilly also used brain scans to track disease progression.Donanemab clears amyloid that had built up over decades and slows decline by an average of 35% over 18 months. While such benefits are modest, the drug can extend patients’ ability to function independently by months and, possibly, years. Patients also get precious more time with loved ones.Catching and treating Alzheimer’s early, as with many diseases, improves the prognosis. Patients in earlier stages of the disease notably showed greater benefits from the drug. Nearly half experienced no decline after one year. Among those in the earliest stage, donanemab slowed decline on average by 60%.Donanemab’s benefits continued even after patients stopped taking the monthly infusions. Nobody wants to be on a drug for the rest of their lives, especially one that carries a small risk of brain bleeding that must be continuously monitored. The FDA panel unanimously agreed that donanemab’s benefits exceed the risks.Scientists disagree about Alzheimer’s causes, but many believe that amyloid drives a degenerative neurological cascade, which results in brain inflammation and neuron death. Amyloid develops decades before patients show cognitive symptoms. Donanemab is the third drug to show that removing amyloid early in the disease can slow decline.Few cancers are knocked out with a one-drug punch. A combination of medicines may be needed to arrest Alzheimer’s, which has been linked to many potential causes, including certain genes, infections, brain trauma, smoking and poor deep sleep.If approved, donanemab will compete with the anti-amyloid lecanemab by Biogen and Eisai, which showed somewhat fewer side effects in trials. Donanemab requires an infusion only once a month compared to twice for lecanemab. Patients can weigh the risks against the benefits with their doctors and caregivers.Meantime, artificial intelligence is accelerating the development of blood tests that can diagnose Alzheimer's and predict it years before patients show cognitive problems. This holds the promise that anti-amyloid treatments might soon be used for prevention, as statins are for heart disease.After Lilly’s major trial ended in failure eight years ago, many scientists declared Alzheimer’s untreatable. They were wrong. Lilly shows that perseverance can pay off.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-12T18:19:28+05:30"},

All you need to knowDiphtheria is a highly contagious infection that can affect the nose and throat, and sometimes the skin. If left untreated, it can prove fatal.Diphtheria, a vaccine-preventable disease, is caused by strains of a bacterium called 'Corynebacterium diphtheria' that make toxins. The disease can lead to breathing, heart rhythm problems and even death.Diphtheria is mainly spread by coughs and sneezes, or through close contact with someone who is infected and material objects (toys or clothes) used by the person already contracted diphtheria.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-19T18:37:50+05:30"},

However, the Cambridge study, published on June 18, has nullified this notion, revealing that regulatory T cells exist instead as a single population of cells which travel across the body to repair damaged tissues.&nbsp;Cambridge scientists reached this conclusion after observing and analysing the regulatory T cells present in 48 different tissues in mice bodies. This experiment proved that the cells are not fixed or limited to specific regions, but rather move throughout the body.&nbsp;Also read | Don't let hype around AI distract us from our progress in brain studies&nbsp;“It's difficult to think of a disease, injury or infection that doesn’t involve some kind of immune response, and our finding really changes the way we could control this response,” Professor Adrian Liston, a senior author of the paper, said.Liston called regulatory T cells a “unified healer army” and said they possess the potential to be exercised in the treatment of numerous diseases going forward.Using a self-designed drug, researchers have demonstrated that regulatory T cells can now be directed to a particular part of the body, increased in number, and eventually activated to block the body’s immune response and boost healing in just one area. This allows the body to treat itself in a localised manner, while the rest of the immune system functions normally.&nbsp;This finding could thus prove beneficial in creating drugs that target specific regions or organs in the body. It would be especially fruitful in the enhancement of anti-inflammatory drugs, which currently impact the entire body instead of just the pain-ridden areas.&nbsp;Regulatory T cells also fuel hair regrowth by interacting with hair tissue stem cells and facilitating their regeneration. They can thus help treat illnesses like alopecia, an autoimmune disorder where hair follicles are destroyed, resulting in hair loss. The new discovery can help improve such existing mechanisms performed by regulatory T cells.&nbsp;Also read | Researchers discover new cell type that may affect human lung disease.

After a three-day spiritual journey in Kanniyakumari, I have just boarded the plane for Delhi. Through the day, Kashi and numerous other places have been in the midst of voting.My mind is filled with so many experiences and emotions... I feel a boundless flow of energy within myself. The 2024 Lok Sabha elections are the first in the Amrit Kaal. I began my campaign a few months ago from Meerut, the land of the First War of Independence of 1857. Since then, I have traversed across the length and breadth of our great nation. The final rally of these elections took me to Hoshiarpur in Punjab, the land of the great Gurus and a land associated with Sant Ravidas Ji. After that, I came to Kanniyakumari, at the feet of Maa Bharti.It is natural that the fervour of the elections was echoing in my heart and mind. The multitude of faces seen in rallies and road shows came in front of my eyes. The blessings from our Nari Shakti…the trust, the affection, all of this was a very humbling experience. My eyes were getting moist... I entered into a ‘sadhana’ (meditative state). And then, the heated political debates, the attacks and counter-attacks, the voices and words of accusations which are so characteristic of an election…they all vanished into a void. A sense of detachment came to grow within me...my mind became completely detached from the external world.Meditation becomes challenging amidst such huge responsibilities, but the land of Kanniyakumari and the inspiration of Swami Vivekananda made it effortless. As a candidate myself, I left my campaign in the hands of my beloved people of Kashi and came here.I am also grateful to God for instilling me with these values from birth which I have cherished and tried to live up to. I was also thinking about what Swami Vivekananda must have experienced during his meditation at this very place in Kanniyakumari! A part of my meditation was spent in a similar stream of thoughts.Amidst this detachment, amidst the peace and silence, my mind was constantly thinking about the bright future of Bharat, the goals of Bharat. The rising sun at Kanniyakumari gave new heights to my thoughts, the vastness of the ocean expanded my ideas, and the expanse of the horizon continuously made me realize the unity, the Oneness, embedded in the depths of the universe. It seemed as if the observations and experiences undertaken in the lap of the Himalayas decades ago were being revived.Kanniyakumari has always been very close to my heart. The Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanniyakumari was built under the leadership of Shri Eknath Ranade ji. I had the opportunity to travel extensively with Eknath ji. During the construction of this Memorial, I had the opportunity to spend some time in Kanniyakumari as well.From Kashmir to Kanniyakumari... this is a common identity that is deeply ingrained in the heart of every citizen of the country. This is the ‘Shakti Peeth’ (seat of Shakti) where Maa Shakti incarnated as Kanya Kumari. At this Southern tip, Maa Shakti performed penance and waited for Bhagwan Shiva, who was residing in the Himalayas at the northernmost parts of Bharat.Kanniyakumari is the land of confluences. The sacred rivers of our country flow into different seas, and here, those very seas converge. And here, we witness another great confluence—the ideological confluence of Bharat! Here, we find the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, a grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar, Gandhi Mandapam, and Kamarajar Mani Mandapam. These streams of thought from these stalwarts converge here to form a confluence of national thought. This gives rise to great inspirations for nation-building. This land of Kanniyakumari gives an indelible message of unity, especially to any person who doubts Bharat’s nationhood and the sense of unity.The grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar in Kanniyakumari seems to be looking at the expanse of Maa Bharati from the sea. His work Thirukkural is one of the crown jewels of the beautiful Tamil language. It covers every aspect of life, inspiring us to give our best for ourselves and for the nation. It was my great fortune to pay my respects to such a great figure.Swami Vivekananda once said, 'Every nation has a message to deliver, a mission to fulfil, a destiny to reach.'For thousands of years, Bharat has been moving forward with this sense of meaningful purpose. Bharat has been a cradle of ideas for thousands of years. We have never considered what we have acquired as our personal wealth or measured it purely by economic or material parameters. Therefore, ‘Idam-na-mama’ (this is not mine) has become an inherent and natural part of the character of Bharat.Bharat’s welfare benefits our planet’s journey to progress as well. Take the freedom movement as an example. Bharat gained independence on August 15, 1947. At that time, many countries around the world were under colonial rule. Bharat’s independence journey inspired and empowered many of those countries to achieve their own freedom. That same spirit was seen decades later when the world came face to face with the once in a century Covid-19 pandemic. When concerns were raised about the poor and developing countries, Bharat’s successful efforts provided courage and assistance to many nations.Today, Bharat’s governance model has become an example for many countries around the world. Empowering 25 crore people to rise above poverty in just 10 years is unprecedented. Innovative practices such as Pro-People Good Governance, aspirational districts, and aspirational blocks are being discussed globally today. Our efforts, from empowering the poor to last-mile delivery, have inspired the world by prioritizing individuals standing at the last rung of society. Bharat’s Digital India campaign is now an example for the entire world, showing how we can use technology to empower the poor, bring transparency, and ensure their rights. Inexpensive data in Bharat is becoming a means of social equality by ensuring the reach of information and services to the poor. The whole world is witnessing and studying the democratization of technology, and major global institutions are advising many countries to adopt elements from our model.Today, Bharat’s progress and rise are not just a significant opportunity for Bharat alone, but also a historic opportunity for all our partner countries around the world. Since the success of the G-20, the world has been increasingly envisioning a bigger role for Bharat. Today, Bharat is being acknowledged as a strong and important voice of the Global South. The African Union has become a part of the G-20 group at the initiative of Bharat. This is going to be a crucial turning point for the future of African countries.The development trajectory of Bharat fills us with pride and glory, but at the same time, it also reminds the 140 crore citizens of their responsibilities. Now, without wasting a single moment, we must step forward towards greater duties and larger goals. We need to dream new dreams, convert them into reality and begin living those dreams.We must see Bharat’s development in a global context, and for this, it is essential that we understand Bharat’s internal capabilities. We must acknowledge Bharat’s strengths, nurture them, and utilize them for the benefit of the world. In today's global scenario, Bharat’s strength as a youthful nation is an opportunity from which we must not look back.The world of the 21st century is looking towards Bharat with many hopes. And we will need to make several changes to move forward in the global scenario. We also need to change our traditional thinking regarding reform. Bharat cannot limit reform to just economic reforms. We must move forward in every aspect of life towards the direction of reform. Our reforms should also align with the aspirations of a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed India) by 2047.We must also understand that reform can never be a unidimensional process for any country. Therefore, I have laid out the vision of reform, perform, and transform for the country. The responsibility of reform lies with leadership. Based on that, our bureaucracy performs, and when the people join in with the spirit of Jan Bhagidari, we witness a transformation taking place.We must make excellence the fundamental principle to make our country a ‘Viksit Bharat’. We need to work quickly in all four directions: Speed, Scale, Scope, and Standards. Alongside manufacturing, we must also focus on quality and adhere to the mantra of 'zero defect-zero effect'.We should take pride in every moment that God has blessed us with birth in the land of Bharat. God has chosen us to serve Bharat and fulfil our role in our country’s journey towards excellence.We must redefine our heritage in a modern way while embracing ancient values in a modern context.As a nation, we also need to reassess outdated thinking and beliefs. We need to free our society from the pressure of professional pessimists. We must remember that freedom from negativity is the first step towards achieving success. Success blossoms in the lap of positivity.My faith, devotion, and belief in the infinite and eternal power of Bharat are growing day by day. Over the past 10 years, I have seen this capability of Bharat grow even more and have experienced it firsthand.Just as we utilized the fourth and fifth decades of the 20th century to impart a new momentum to the freedom movement, we must lay the foundation for a ‘Viksit Bharat’ in these 25 years of the 21st century. The freedom struggle was a time that called for great sacrifices. The present times call for great and sustained contributions from everyone.Swami Vivekananda had said in 1897 that we must dedicate the next 50 years solely for the nation. Exactly 50 years after this call, Bharat gained independence in 1947.Today, we have the same golden opportunity. Let's dedicate the next 25 years solely for the nation. Our efforts will create a strong foundation for the coming generations and the coming centuries, taking Bharat to new heights. Looking at the energy and enthusiasm of the country, I can say that the goal is not far away now. Let us take swift steps. Let us come together and create a Viksit Bharat.These thoughts were penned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 1 June between 4:15pm and 7pm during his return flight from Kanniyakumari to Delhi.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-03T06:00:02+05:30"},

This only served to amplify the fervent cheers of Spanish fans during the two-hour battle.What meant most to the 37-year-old, 36-time ATP Masters 1000 champion was the heartfelt applause of his fans and the tears shed by family members in his players' box.Reflecting on his farewell, Nadal expressed mixed emotions, stating that a few weeks ago he didn't know if he would compete in an official match again.\"It's been a very special week for me, very positive in many ways, both personally and for my tennis. I had the chance to play again on the court. A few weeks ago, two days before Barcelona, I didn't know if I would compete in an official match again and I've now played for two weeks. It's been unforgettable,\" Nadal said on the court as quoted by ATP.\"The only thing I can say is 'thank you'. It's been an incredible journey that started when I was little. I came to Madrid for the first time in 2003, when the tournament was played indoors. The first time I came here feeling competitive was in 2005. It was one of the most exciting wins of my career, still indoors. Ever since the support has been unconditional from everyone. I cannot thank you enough,\" he added.In an attempt to reach his 100th ATP Masters 1000 quarterfinal, Rafael Nadal looked up at the unfolded banners commemorating his five victories from 2008, '10, '13-'14, and '17, which made him think about the length of his career.\"Looking at the pictures [on the banners], some of them seem like they were a lifetime ago. All I can do is thank everyone who has helped me in my career. Even though it's not over, this is the last time I'll be in Madrid. You have given me a gift for the last 21 years that's more significant than any Grand Slam I have won. The emotions of playing in Madrid, in front of the Spanish fans, is something that will stay with me forever,\" said the Spaniard.\"I've been lucky enough to be able to do a hobby as my job, and to do it exceptionally well. I feel so lucky to have had all these experiences. I couldn't ask for more. I hope I've set a positive example for the new generations. That's the most important thing. Titles and sporting moments are exciting,\" he added.Nadal expressed gratitude for the memories the game and the supporters had provided him over the years. His attention now shifts to the Olympics (where he has hinted at doubles run with Carlos Alcaraz), the Laver Cup, Roland Garros (assuming he thinks his body can handle the rigours of five-set tennis), and the Masters 1000 in Rome next week.\"Sport generates excitement and emotion. I have experienced it as a fan. From what I can see, I hope that I've created excitement and emotion for all of you. The only thing I can say is 'thank you'. That's all I can say. That's how I feel. It was one of those days that are difficult when they arrive. I think that life and my body have been sending me messages for some time that this day had to come,\" he said.\"I've been lucky to do it at one of the places that has been the most emotional for me. Thank you. I'd like to thank Feli, Gerard and Jon, and everyone who made it possible for the tournament to be played in Madrid. It's amazing for all the Spanish players and I'm sure the next generations will continue to enjoy the atmosphere here.

Probably one is to say, Okay, I am not ready, I am not playing well enough. Then is the moment to take a decision in terms of not playing Roland Garros. Another is to accept how I am today and work the proper way to try to be in a different way in two weeks,\" Nadal said as quoted by ATP.The Spaniard stated he will \"try\" his hardest to be fit for the French Open, but he has a \"decision\" to make.\"The decision, as you can imagine, is not clear in my mind today. But if I have to say what's my feeling and if my mind is closer one way or the other way, I'm going to say I will be in Roland Garros and try my best,\" he added.\"Physically I have some issues, but not probably yet enough to say not playing in the most important event of my tennis career. Let's see what's going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week. If I feel ready, I'm going to try to be there and fight for the things that I have been fighting the last 15 years, even if now it seems impossible,\" said the former World No. 1.However, a dismal conclusion to his 2024 campaign will not cloud Nadal's recollections of his exploits in Rome.\"I always say that I will never be able to say thank you enough for all the love and support that I receive around the world. Here in Rome is obviously one of the most important events in my tennis career, one of these events that is going to be in my heart for so many reasons,\" Nadal said as quoted by ATP.\"Here I played a few of the most important matches, beautiful matches, emotional ones. In a lot of moments of my tennis career, I was able to come back from tough moments playing here in Rome, especially the last eight years when I arrived here with some doubts, then I started to play well here. Obviously, it was not the case today, but it really happened in the past. I enjoyed a lot playing in this court,\" he added.Nadal was playing in only his third tour-level event since returning from injury in mid-April. Despite the fact that the Spaniard is still striving to recover his best level while easing back in physically, he felt his performance against Hurkacz was an incorrect picture of how he feels.\"He was serving well. It was difficult for me to return. It's difficult to feel yourself with real chances of come back with his serve and without being able to create enough damage to him and creating mistakes,\" said the former No. 1.\"That's it. Just accept that. It was a tough day for me in all ways because I felt more ready than what I showed. That gives me a bad feeling, because [I was] feeling better, [but was not] able to show myself on court... As I said before the tournament started, I am little bit more unpredictable today, not playing enough for the last two years,\" he added.Nadal squandered five break opportunities in the first game of his debut ATP Head2Head match against Hurkacz. That subsequently proved costly, as the Pole settled down behind his serve and gained command of the match in the middle of the first set.\"I think it was a tough one, obviously. It's obvious that I started the match well. First few games, almost half an hour for the first two games, having a few chances and playing well. Then [he] had the break, and I lost a little bit the way to push him back, the way to create that much on him,\" reflected Nadal, who is now 70-9 in the Italian capital.\"In the first set I think the score lied a little bit about what the game was. Then he was much better than me in the second. I didn't have that feeling in the first, but in the second, yeah. I was not able to push him back,\" he added.

That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best,\" said Zverev, who arrives in Paris having won the prestigious Rome Open title.Djokovic under cloudNadal isn't the only A-list talent under a Paris cloud ahead of the tournament start on Sunday.Defending champion and record 24-time Grand Slam title winner Djokovic, whose three titles in Paris put him alongside Gustavo Kuerten, Mats Wilander and Ivan Lendl, is enduring a title dry spell unseen since 2018.Back then, he also reached May without a trophy before crashing to a shock quarter-final defeat at the French Open to unheralded Marco Cecchinato of Italy.This season, Djokovic has lost his Australian Open title and has yet to make a final.Adding injury to insult, he was hit on the head by a falling water bottle in Rome, a freak accident which he claimed caused nausea and dizziness.In an attempt to gather a degree of clay-court confidence, Djokovic, who turned 37 on Wednesday, grabbed a late wild card in the ongoing Geneva tournament.That ended in a shock semi-final loss to 44th-ranked Czech Tomas Machac on Friday.Djokovic starts his campaign on Tuesday against home wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert.Between them, Nadal and Djokovic have carved up the last eight French Open titles while 2009 was the last time a final at Roland Garros did not feature at least one of them.World number two Jannik Sinner, the man who succeeded Djokovic as Australian Open champion, has been laid low by a hip injury which caused him to skip the Rome Open.The 22-year-old Italian reached the quarter-finals of the French Open on his debut in 2020 where he was defeated by Nadal in straight sets.\"I'm not concerned anymore about my hip. The last tests we made, they were very positive. That's why I'm here,\" said the Italian.Sinner, who faces Chris Eubanks of the United States in his opener, has an extra incentive to progress deep in Paris as he could depose Djokovic as world number one.Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning Wimbledon champion, also skipped Rome to nurse an arm injury.The world number three, who meets American lucky loser J.J. Wolf in his first round, took a set off Djokovic in their semi-final last year before body cramps saw him slip to defeat.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-25T09:21:03+05:30"},

Nadal was about 1½ years older when he did it.Sunday’s victory — in which he trailed two sets to one, just as he had in the semifinals against Jannik Sinner on Friday — allowed Alcaraz to add the clay-court championship at Roland Garros to his triumphs on hard courts at the U.S. Open in 2022 and on grass at Wimbledon in 2023.Alcaraz is now 3-0 in Grand Slam finals.Zverev dropped to 0-2 in major title matches. The 27-year-old from Germany was the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open after blowing a two-set lead against Dominic Thiem.This time, Zverev lost after surging in front by reeling off the last five games of the third set. Alcaraz’s level dipped during that stretch and he seemed distracted by a complaint over the condition of the clay at Court Philippe Chatrier, telling chair umpire Renaud Lichtenstein it was “unbelievable.”But Alcaraz reset himself and surged to the finish, taking 12 of the last 15 games while being treated by a trainer at changeovers for an issue with his left leg.No. 3 Alcaraz and No. 4 Zverev were making their first appearance in a French Open final. Indeed, this was the first men’s title match at Roland Garros since 2004 without Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer.Nadal lost to Zverev in the first round two weeks ago; Djokovic, a three-time champion, withdrew before the quarterfinals with a knee injury that required surgery; Federer is retired.There were some jitters at the outset. Zverev started the proceedings with a pair of double-faults — walking to the sideline to change rackets after the second, as though the equipment was the culprit — and eventually got broken. Alcaraz lost serve immediately, too, framing a forehand that sent the ball into the stands — which he would do on a handful of occasions — and double-faulting, trying a so-so drop shot that led to an easy winner for Zverev, then missing a backhand.Let’s just say they won’t be putting those initial 10 minutes in the Louvre. A lot of the 4-hour, 19-minute match was patchy, littered with unforced errors.Alcaraz managed to come out strong in the fourth set, grabbing 16 of the first 21 points to move out to a 4-0 edge, including one brilliant, sliding, down-the-line forehand passing winner that he celebrated by thrusting his right index finger overhead in a “No. 1” sign, then throwing an uppercut while screaming, “Vamos!”No, he is not ranked No. 1 at the moment — Sinner makes his debut at the top spot on Monday — but he has been before and, although a “2” will be beside Alcaraz’s name next week, there is little doubt that he is as good as it gets in men’s tennis right now.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-09T23:07:15+05:30"},

He began his speech with humour, admitting it was only his second time on a college campus.Dressed in an unfamiliar robe, he joked about his discomfort and how he had worn shorts almost every day for the past 35 years. He reflected on his journey, sharing lessons learned from tennis that he hoped would resonate with the graduates.Effortless is a mythThe first lesson was that \"effortless\" was a myth.

Now, I have a question for all of you... what percentage of the POINTS do you think I won in those matches? Only 54%,” he said.“When you’re playing a point, it is the most important thing in the world. But when it’s behind you, it’s behind you,” he added.Life is bigger than the courtFederer’s final lesson was that life is bigger than the court. He shared his passion for travel, culture and philanthropy.

I just try to bowl good balls and see what is required for the team. There's nothing called your own performance in this sport. It's all about what's required, bowling the right ball and right situation. In that process, if I get a wicket, it's good.\"Pandya also talked about the hard work he does in order to keep performing in all areas. He said, “There's a lot of hard work that I need to do to fire on all cylinders. It gives me extra opportunity to contribute to the team and lifts my confidence.

The current support staff includes Vikram Rathour as batting coach, Paras Mhambrey as bowling coach and T Dilip as fielding coach.The third, and perhaps most controversial, condition is that Gambhir wants to sack four senior Indian players: Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami if they fail to perform in the upcoming Champions Trophy 2025 in Pakistan.Fourthly, Gambhir wants a separate team for Test cricket.Finally, Gambhir wants to start preparing the roadmap for the 2027 ODI World Cup from the very beginning.‘I don’t see that far ahead': Gautam Gambhir on India head coach roleNotably, Gambhir was recently asked about what he thought about taking the India head coach to which the former India batter said it was difficult to answer the question right now.Gambhir said, “I don't see that far ahead.

When you keep an open mind and not just think of one shot, you can access all areas of the field.”\"200 is obviously a good score, but when you're playing on grounds like this where wind is a factor, anything is possible, but I thought we used the conditions very well. It was very pleasing to see how we were getting through those overs and getting the wickets at the same time,\" he added.The skipper further added that he would like India to continue playing the same way in the knockouts in the manner they have played so far. “We don't want to do anything different (in the knockouts). We want to play the same way, understand what the individuals need to do in a given situation, and play freely. So far we've been doing that consistently, and semifinals, we have to try and do the same thing. It'll be nice (to play England in the semifinal). Nothing changes for us, we want to focus on what we can do as a team, and take the game on.”Mitchell Marsh dissappointed“It's disappointing. Still technically a chance to go through, and today India got the better of us. I think over the course of 40 overs there's a lot of small margins, but honestly, India were the better team.”\"We've seen for 15 years what Rohit Sharma can do in that kind of mood, and he got off to an absolute flier.

The new model is available for free on the Claude website and iOS app. However, premium users will get up to 5x higher rate limits.According to Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro in most overall and vision benchmarks. The new language model comes with a 200K token context window, which translates to around 1500 words.In terms of real-world use, Anthropic says Claude 3.5 is claimed to be better at understanding nuance, humour and complex instructions while also offering a more natural and relatable tone in its writing.

This means that even the latest iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will not get the new AI features.Speaking to John Gruber of the Daring Fireball podcast, John Giannandrea (Apple's vice president of machine learning and AI strategy) explained the reason behind why Apple's new AI features are not coming to older devices. He said while the AI models that power Apple Intelligence could theoretically run a very old device, they would be so slow that they would not be useful at all.Giannandrea said, “The inference of large language models is incredibly computationally expensive… You could in theory run these models on a very old device, but it would be so slow that it would not be useful\"4) WhatsApp could soon rollout a new QR code feature for transferring chats:Meta-owned personal messaging platform WhatsApp is reportedly gearing up to introduce a slew of new updates aimed at enhancing user experience, with a standout feature that simplifies chat history transfers between devices through QR codes.According to WABetaInfo, this innovative chat transfer capability is part of the latest beta version, 2.24.9.19, and promises to make moving chat data from one device to another significantly easier, bypassing the need for Google Drive.Reportedly, the upcoming feature is likely to leverage QR codes to directly transfer chat data between devices.

It’s cost-effective, allowing small productions to shine. And the instant feedback loop helps refine strategies on the go. Influencers step in around two weeks before the release, to promote a film. Their tasks revolve around building anticipation, either by highlighting the movie’s plot or showcasing a song that acts as a bait,” Manish Solanki, the chief operating officer and co-founder of digital and social media marketing agency TheSmallBigIdea, said.Budgets are usually flexible, depending on the variety of the collaborations with artists, or music videos that serve as a teaser, or podcasts revealing behind-the-scenes secrets and even dance-offs—but all of it is to generate excitement, said Solanki. However, the involvement doesn’t end at the film’s premiere, he added.“Even after release, influencers become critics, dissecting and discussing the movie’s ups and downs, sharing their perspectives to post-release discussions,” he said.Mitesh Kothari, co-founder and the chief creative officer of digital marketeer White Rivers Media, said the influencers have a talent for seamlessly weaving the content into their feeds, such as trailers into their skits or showcasing unique interactions involving lead actors.White Rivers had partnered Anushka Sen for the promotion of The Super Mario Bros Movie and with Aashta Shah for Zara Hatke Zara Bachke .A common means of collaboration between film stars and influencers before the movie’s release is sketches, said Divyansh Gala, group head for outreach at SoCheers.“Many influencers engage in activities that may not even have anything to do with the film’s plot.” he said, citing the instance of Varun Dhawan and Janhvi Kapoor‘s Bawaal for which the actors were seen in a video with content creator and influencer Dharna Durga.Chanchlani, who ran a social media campaign for Ranveer Singh’s comedy drama Cirkus, has created content around Hollywood releases, including Marvel movies. “At least 50% of what was earlier spent on promoting trailers on YouTube has now gone to influencers. That is a big shift,” Gala said.“For choosing an influencer for film promotion, the common factor is their substantial and broad audience appeal, not catering to a niche group, instead belonging to the general entertainment genres like lifestyle, music or dance,” said Hitarth Dadia, chief marketing officer and partner at Mumbai-based Nofiltr group.“These creators might specialize in creating humorous sketches or thought-provoking content. Additionally, promotions may also involve dancers and lifestyle creators. Occasionally, these influencers might even be invited to premieres. The selection of influencers isn’t solely based on their genre but rather on the audience they can reach,” Dadia said.Interestingly, there’s been a noticeable emergence of new and region-specific influencers from smaller towns who are gaining prominence and recognition, leveraging their unique perspectives and cultural backgrounds to connect with audiences, he added.", "Published_Date": "2023-09-01T23:40:49+05:30"},

While most large OTT content creators in India have their own in-house legal teams that take care of the day-to-day functioning of the platform, including its content, law firms can get involved at various stages, depending on the complexity and scale of a particular project,” Snigdhaneel Satpathy, partner at Saraf and Partners, a law firm, said.Legally-vetted ContentLaw firms may be involved right at the beginning to ensure that the concept of a show does not infringe on intellectual property rights. At the scripting stage, legal experts can review scripts for potential defamation, privacy violations, and other legal risks, Satpathy said. In the production phase, law firms can assist with contracts, negotiations, and ensuring that the filming process adheres to labour laws, location permits, and other relevant legal requirements. Post-production, law firms may assist with clearance of rights for music, clips, and other media used in the show.Also read: Celebrities’ legal fight for intellectual property: A double-edged swordCultural sensitivity is paramount in a country where religious beliefs are deeply ingrained, said Ayan Sharma, head of public policy and advocacy, BTG Advaya. “The online series Tandav faced legal action and an FIR due to accusations of hurting religious sentiments by portraying Hindu deities negatively and allegedly inciting religious tensions. To navigate legal challenges and maintain positive audience reception, OTT platforms must strike a balance between creative expression and cultural sensitivity, bearing which in mind becomes necessary for the green-lighting of projects,” Sharma said, referring to one of the key areas for legal guidance nowadays.Ensure Data SecurityMoreover, legal firms are advising platforms to implement robust data security measures and obtain clear user consent for data collection, said Anupam Shukla, partner, Pioneer Legal.“This helps avoid hefty fines and reputational damage,” Shukla said. Further, past controversies involving objectionable content have led to a more rigorous content vetting process. Lawyers now advise platforms to conduct thorough due diligence on scripts, storylines, and even social media profiles of creators to identify potential red flags, he added.Also read: OTT players turning to legal experts before airing political dramasVinay Butani, partner at Economic Laws Practice, said that other than the 2021 IT Rules that impose specific obligations on OTT platforms, such as adhering to a Code of Ethics and implementing self-regulatory measures, services are also subject to the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995 and associated rules, which apply to platforms featuring television-like content. “These regulations mandate compliance with programming and advertising standards, with penalties for content that violates decency, morality, or incites violence,” Butani said.Licensing Agreements and ContractsTo be sure, legal firms advise OTT platforms across originals and acquired content, the two main programming buckets for most services. “In relation to original content, assistance includes advising on compliance with content regulations set by regulatory bodies like the ministry of information and broadcasting, drafting contracts for artistes such as writers, composers, actors, singers and production crew, ensuring intellectual property protection for original creations, and addressing any legal issues that may arise during the content creation process,” Dhiraj Mhetre, partner, Khaitan Legal Associates, said.Also read: Should OTT platforms be regulated the same way cable television is?“When a platform is acquiring content from Indian or international sources, legal firms help negotiate assignment or licensing agreements, distribution deals, and revenue-sharing arrangements as well as in conducting due diligence to verify the chain of title and rights clearance, assess any potential legal risks associated with the acquired content, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing content distribution and licensing” Mhetre added.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-29T17:35:55+05:30"},

Brokerages have predicted Reliance Jio to spend about  ₹3,700 crore, as it may look to increase its spectrum holding in certain circles in the 800MHz band, having tanked up on 5G spectrum across the 800 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2300 MHz bands in the 2022 5G auctions. ;Also Read: Satcom spectrum allocation further delayedJefferies said in a note in March that Bharti Airtel could spend a minimum of  ₹3,800 crore as it will have to renew 42MHz of spectrum in 1800MHz and 900MHz bands in six circles. It may also bid in certain circles to increase its holding in 800MHz/1800MHz bands to 10-15MHz and in 2300MHz band to 40MHz. This could lead to a maximum spend of  ₹123 billion or  ₹12,300 crore. ;Airtel’s MD and CEO Gopal Vittal had said in the September-quarter earnings call that the carrier will be spending less than usual in the upcoming spectrum auctions, as it will not need additional airwaves other than some renewal spectrum in a few circles. Airtel intends to add at least 25,000 5G sites in circles of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh, Kerala and West Bengal to improve rural area coverage.Vodafone Idea on the other hand has chosen against renewing some its spectrum in the circles of West Bengal and UP West, where renewals for 12MHz in the 1800MHz and 900MHz band are due. Analysts noted that since the country’s third-largest carrier by subscribers has adequate spectrum in the same circles in the 1800MHz band, it may not go for renewal of spectrum in the 1800MHz band, and therefore would end up reducing its spends on renewals from  ₹1,500 crore to  ₹200 crore for just 900MHz band.  ;Also Read | Allot or auction satellite telecom spectrum?

Here's what you should know | Mint", "Author": "Aman Gupta", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/aman-gupta", "Content": "Google Maps has announced a number of privacy-focused features designed to give users more control over their personal information. The Mountain View, California-based company said the new features will be rolled out to Android and iOS users over the next year, and users will receive a notification when the update is available for their account.In a blog post about the new features coming to Maps, Google wrote: “Your location information is personal. We’re committed to keeping it safe, private and in your control… So you can spend less time worrying about your data, and more time exploring new places, getting where you need to go or hanging out with friends — all with the help of Maps.”1) More control over location data:&nbsp;Google said on Tuesday that it will soon start storing users' location data directly on their device, a move touted as giving users more control over their data. Notably, the location history setting is turned off by default and users will be able to delete all or part of their location timeline at any time or turn off the setting entirely.2) End-to-end encryption on cloud:&nbsp;Google says that users will be able to back up their location data to the cloud to protect it from being lost, and that the data stored in the cloud will be end-to-end encrypted, meaning that no one other than the end user will be able to access this information. The Android maker says this feature will be particularly useful for users who are getting a new phone or are at risk of losing their existing device.3) Changes to location history policy:Google has announced that it will now set a default timeline of three months for auto-deleting location history, meaning that any data older than that will be automatically deleted. Before this upgrade, Google Maps data was set to auto-delete after 18 months by default. However, users can still choose to increase the duration of their location history or turn off the auto-delete settings.4) Delete all data related to a specific location:&nbsp;Google Maps users will soon be able to delete all information related to their recent activity for a specific location on Maps in a few simple steps. While Google still offers the option to remove location data in the Maps app, the new settings will allow users to also remove data related to Google web and app activity all at once, reported The Verge.5) Changes to blue dot:&nbsp;Google said that the blue dot in the Maps app, which previously showed users their location, will now also allow them to take a look at some important privacy settings. By tapping on the blue dot, all users will now be able to see if their location history or timeline settings are turned on, or if they have given Maps access to their device's location&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2023-12-13T14:37:29+05:30"},

'Butterflies,' a new social media platform developed by Vu Tran, a former engineering manager at Snap, is now available worldwide on iOS and Android, reported HT Tech. This innovative app lets users create and interact with AI-driven characters called 'Butterflies,' offering a novel twist on traditional social media engagement.Having recently concluded a phase of private beta testing, Butterflies has launched globally, free of charge and free from in-app purchases, adds the publication. The platform's design is reminiscent of Instagram, complete with familiar tabs such as Home, Search (which also serves as a recommendation tool), Direct Messages (DMs), and Profile, all conveniently located at the bottom of the interface.As per the publication, upon signing up, users are guided through a comprehensive process to create their own Butterfly. This includes selecting an art style ranging from realistic to cartoon-like, providing a description prompt, naming the character, choosing personality traits and preferences, writing a backstory, and picking a profile picture. The app's AI then brings the Butterfly to life, enabling it to autonomously post photos, write captions, engage with other posts, and respond to messages.Reportedly, users can interact with these AI characters or simply observe their activities. Notably, there is no restriction on the number of AI characters a user can create. Each Butterfly features a 'created by' tag to distinguish it from real users, and users have a dedicated section on their profiles to display all the AI characters they have created.Butterflies stands out in the social media world by fostering a dynamic community where AI characters and human users coexist and interact. While platforms like Character.AI and Meta's experiments with AI on Messenger have explored similar concepts, Butterflies sets itself apart with its extensive and interactive ecosystem for AI-human interaction on a global stage.As the platform gains traction, it is poised to offer a compelling blend of creativity and connectivity, reshaping how users engage with both digital and real-world entities.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-20T19:58:49+05:30"},

Safe Superintelligence is rooted in both Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, leveraging their strong connections in these regions to attract top-tier technical talent.This announcement follows Sutskever's involvement in a failed attempt to oust OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last year, a move that has already sparked significant internal conflict regarding the balance between business pursuits and AI safety priorities at OpenAI.

The NDA's consistent emphasis on economic reforms, infrastructural development, and ease of doing business has historically resonated well with the investor community.This new tenure promises to build upon these foundations, potentially offering numerous opportunities for NRI investors. Here’s a closer look at what NDA's third term means for NRI investors, but before that a glance at the horizon of the Indian economy.The longer vision of India under Modi 3.0 governmentWith India aiming to emerge as the fourth-largest economy by 2026 surpassing Japan and as the third-largest economy with its GDP crossing $5 trillion by 2027 surpassing Germany, the next term in office for the government is to execute and capitalise on the momentum built in the last few years.India’s GDP growth rate of 8.2% for FY24 is the highest among all major large economies; showcasing the growth of the economy and the opportunities it will bring for the nation.What’s in it for NRI investors?Indian markets outperformed global counterparts across three, five, and ten-year periods. Nifty Large Cap Index delivered a 10.9 per cent annualised return in the past 10 years. Over the same period, the US Index and China’s market delivered only 6 per cent and 2.7 per cent.Similarly in the last five years, Indian markets delivered 18.8 per cent while the US Index delivered only 7.6 per cent. India markets recently solidified its position as the most emerging market as per Morgan Stanley, a trajectory that showcases it as a potentially high return-yielding market for the upcoming future. Here are the things to look forward to Modi 3.0 government:Continued economic reforms and stabilityThe NDA government has been known for its economic reforms. Initiatives such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and various financial inclusion schemes have established a robust economic framework.With the NDA back in power, NRI investors can expect the continuation and enhancement of these reforms, fostering an environment of stability and predictability essential for long-term investments. While reforms like GST take time to show returns, the immediate impact can be seen via fiscal policies.Enhanced ease of doing businessIndia has climbed significantly in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings under the NDA’s tenure. The third term is likely to witness further streamlining of regulatory processes, making it even more convenient for NRIs to invest in India.This could include simplified processes for property transactions, financial investments, and business set-ups, ensuring that NRIs face minimal bureaucratic hurdles.Focus on infrastructure developmentThe NDA's focus on infrastructure development has been a major foray of its economic strategy. Major projects such as the Bharatmala project, Smart Cities Mission, GatiShakti Scheme, and the expansion of national highways have boosted the real estate, logistics, and construction sectors.Continued investments in these areas are expected to create lucrative opportunities for NRI investors looking at real estate, infrastructure bonds, and related financial instruments.Strengthening of digital India and technological advancementsThe digital India initiative has revolutionised the way business is conducted in India. The push towards a cashless economy, increased internet penetration, and the promotion of digital literacy is expected to transform the economic landscape further.With a continued focus on technological advancements, the NDA’s third term is expected to bolster sectors such as fintech, e-commerce, and digital services. NRI investors can capitalise on these growing sectors by investing in tech-driven startups, IT services, and digital infrastructure projects.Opportunities in renewable energyIndia has ambitious goals for its power and renewable energy sector, aiming to reach a $1 trillion economy in this space by 2030. The launch of the “PM Suryodaya Yojana 2024” with an allocation of  ₹10,000 crore underscores the government’s commitment to solar energy.This initiative is expected to drive substantial solar power generation growth, reduce fossil fuel dependency, and contribute to environmental sustainability. The NDA’s third term is likely to witness an acceleration in this sector, providing ample investment opportunities for NRIs.Enhanced financial services and NRI-centric policiesThe NDA’s previous terms have seen the introduction of several NRI-friendly financial services and schemes, such as the Sovereign Green Bond Scheme and various NRI banking facilities. The third term is anticipated to bring further enhancements in this area, with more tailored financial products, investment schemes, and policies designed to cater to the unique needs of the NRI community.One more efficient channel for streamlining NRI and foreign investments in India is GIFT City with the GOI aiming for it to become a hub for sustainable finance.In conclusion, the NDA's third term in governance promises a continuation of its pro-investment policies, economic reforms, and infrastructural advancements. For NRI investors, this translates into a stable and promising investment environment, characterised by reduced red tape, enhanced ease of doing business, and numerous opportunities across various sectors.As India continues its journey towards becoming a global economic powerhouse, NRI investors are well-positioned to reap substantial benefits from the NDA’s governance.Mudit Vijayvergiya, founder of SBNRI&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T10:59:08+05:30"},

Diversifying across different platforms can mitigate risks associated with technical glitches or potential malpractices.Regularly monitor investments: Stay vigilant by regularly checking your investment portfolios directly through fund houses or trusted third-party services like CAMS (Computer Age Management Services), CDSL (Central Depository Services Limited), or NSDL (National Securities Depository Limited). These entities provide independent verification of your holdings.Keep detailed records: Maintain thorough records of your investment transactions, including purchase confirmations, redemption requests, and account statements. These documents serve as crucial evidence in case of discrepancies or disputes.Verify transactions promptly: Upon making any transaction through a digital platform, verify its execution promptly. Cross-check transaction details with your bank statements to ensure that funds have been debited or credited correctly.Stay informed about regulations: Understand the regulatory framework governing digital investment platforms in your jurisdiction. Familiarize yourself with consumer protection rights and procedures for lodging complaints or seeking redressal in case of disputes.Seek professional advice: When in doubt or facing complex issues, seek advice from financial advisors or experts who can provide independent insights and guidance.While digital investment platforms offer convenience and accessibility, incidents like the one involving Groww underscore the importance of due diligence and vigilance.Investors must take proactive steps to protect their investments and financial well-being. Remember, trust is earned through transparency and accountability, qualities essential for any platform handling your financial assets.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T13:56:30+05:30"},

The EPFO plays a crucial role in securing long-term financial stability for employees in India through:Promoting regular savings: Participation in an EPF account requires consistent contributions from both employers and employees, fostering financial discipline and steadily accumulating a significant retirement fund over the years.Assured government returns: Each year, the Indian government determines the interest rate for EPF contributions, which generally exceeds rates offered by traditional savings accounts, ensuring a secure and dependable investment option.Tax advantages: Contributions made to EPF accounts by both employers and employees are eligible for income tax exemptions up to specified limits. This enables employees to enhance their retirement savings while lowering their current tax liabilities.Here are some supplementary advantages provided by the EPFO that enhance long-term financial stability:Retirement benefits: Eligible employees can receive a monthly pension post-retirement through the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS), which is integrated with the EPF for enhanced social security.Life insurance coverage: The EPFO offers life insurance benefits to its members through the Employee Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme. Should a member pass away during their service tenure, their family receives a lump sum payment as compensation.Withdrawal facilities: Members have the option to withdraw a portion of their EPF savings under specific conditions, including medical emergencies, educational expenses for children, or purchasing a home.In summary, the EPFO establishes a robust social security framework that secures the financial future of employees post-retirement.

Dr Bhalla was shocked to discover that despite fully settling his credit card debt in 2003, the issuing bank had erroneously reported him as a defaulter, leading to a significant drop in his CIBIL score by 2012.Upon discovering the error, the doctor pursued justice by presenting his bank statement, which indicated the payment made to the credit card issuer. Armed with this evidence, he approached various authorities for resolution, including the banking ombudsman, district consumer commission, state consumer commission, and finally the NCDRC.It took seven years for the credit card issuing bank to acknowledge its error. Though delayed, justice prevailed when the Ombudsman confirmed the validity of the claim and closed the case. While the outstanding credit card dues were resolved, the damage to the credit history and low credit score persisted. To address these issues caused by the credit card issuer’s mistakes, the doctor pursued legal action.Ultimately, the bank was held accountable for the adverse impact on the doctor’s credit score. This incident may not be isolated, where credit card issuers mistakenly penalize customers despite timely repayments. Such cases highlight the necessity of vigilance and regular monitoring of one’s credit score.Many credit cardholders neglect to verify their card transactions, a critical oversight highlighted by the doctor’s case. This underscores the importance of regularly checking your credit score.Catch errors early: Errors on your credit report are possible and can lower your score. Regularly checking enables you to spot and challenge any inaccuracies before they become problematic.Prevent fraudulent activity: Timely monitoring of your credit report is essential to detect any signs of fraudulent activity. Regular checks enable you to identify suspicious inquiries or unauthorized accounts, allowing you to take swift action to safeguard against identity theft.Track your progress: Regularly monitoring your credit score allows you to observe the results of your efforts to improve it. This can provide motivation and help you maintain your momentum towards your financial goal.Check your score before applying for credit: Understanding your credit score in advance can help you qualify for loans and credit cards with better interest rates. This preparation prevents unnecessary applications for products that may carry higher rates or risk being declined.In summary, regularly monitoring your credit score is essential for maintaining strong financial health. It empowers you to take proactive steps in managing your credit and safeguarding against errors and fraud.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T14:42:59+05:30"},

Naval Ravikant’s approach to achieving wealth and financial success is distinctive because he emphasizes personal growth as a crucial factor for professional achievement. Having a defined financial goal is crucial as it guides decisions on earning money, identifies necessary skills to acquire, and specifies domains or knowledge to pursue.Anthony Jay Robbins, an American author, coach, and speaker, aptly stated, “Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.” By tackling one part at a time, one day at a time, we must achieve any goal we set for ourselves. But where do we begin? You might have dreams and aspirations but lack a starting point. More importantly, how can you transform your financial aspirations into tangible, actionable goals?Clarify your dreamsFirstly, what lifestyle do you imagine? Are you dreaming of globe-trotting, settling in a particular place, or indulging in hobbies without restraint? How much financial support would such a lifestyle necessitate?Secondly, how crucial is financial stability to you? Are you aiming for a substantial safety net, the capability to withstand unforeseen circumstances, or the freedom from debt? Contemplate your long-term aspirations. Are early retirement, funding your children’s education, or leaving a lasting impact on your agenda? Assess which financial objectives resonate most with your principles. Does achieving financial independence matter? Are you interested in contributing to causes dear to you?Adopt SMART objectivesUtilize the SMART framework to transform financial dreams into actionable plans. Here’s how it can be applied to some of the financial aspirations we discussed with examples:1. Short-term GoalDream: Establish an emergency fundSMART Goal: Save  ₹5000 within the next 3 months by allocating a portion of income to a high-interest savings account.2. Mid-term GoalDream: Take a trip to a nearby hill station in two yearsSMART Goal: Accumulate funds for the trip over the next two years by dedicating a portion of monthly earnings to a travel savings account.3. Long-term GoalDream: Retire comfortably at age 60SMART Goal: Consistently save and invest, select appropriate investments aligned with risk tolerance and financial goals. Increase retirement contributions by 2% of salary annually, beginning this year, and adjust contributions based on income growth and investment performance reviews.Arrange in order of importance and categorizePutting your goals into time horizon categories will help you prioritize and ensure your financial plan is comprehensive. After classifying your objectives, you can rank them according to importance for each period. For instance, among short-term objectives, saving for a vacation might not come before emergency fund building.Here are some further suggestions on how to prioritize:Evaluate urgency: Identify which goals require immediate attention.Align with values: Determine which goals are crucial for realizing your broader vision.Consider future impact: Assess how achieving short-term goals can advance your mid-term and long-term objectives.Incorporating these considerations will help you develop a prioritized list to steer your financial decisions effectively.Monitor progress and adjust as neededMonitoring your progress and adjusting your plan are essential for reaching your financial goals. Begin by consistently reviewing your budget and tracking both income and expenses using budgeting apps or spreadsheets. Assess whether you’ve met your monthly savings target and if you’re on course to achieve your short-term goals. Celebrate milestones along the way to maintain motivation. Identify any areas where overspending is consistent and consider reallocating your budget to prioritize specific goals.Additional tips for consideration include:Evaluate your budget: Having a clear grasp of your income and expenses is essential for making well-informed financial decisions.Seek expert advice: A financial advisor can offer customized guidance that aligns with your specific circumstances.Automate your financial tasks: Establish automatic transfers to savings or investment accounts to maintain steady and reliable progress.Achieving financial goals is akin to running a marathon rather than a sprint. It demands perseverance, discipline, and the capacity to acknowledge small victories along the journey. Celebrate milestones, maintain discipline, and adjust your strategy as necessary.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T15:01:59+05:30"},

They said that mutual funds' performance hinges on the market. As Quant Mutual Fund has invested in quality stocks including Reliance, Jio Financial Services, HDFC Bank, Adani Power, Tata Power, SAIL, LIC, and Aurobindo Pharma, chances of any fall in the net asset value (NAV) due to the Sebi action are negligible.Quant Mutual Fund's investment strategyReacting to the news of Sebi's investigation into Quant Mutual Fund, Kartik Jhaveri, a seasoned professional with extensive experience in wealth management as the director at Transcend Capital, provided a reassuring perspective.

MintGenie explains | Mint", "Author": "Abeer Ray", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/abeer-ray", "Content": "Tax season might seem complex! In India, you aren’t required to file a return if your income is below the basic exemption limit, which varies based on your age and chosen tax regime.The threshold for filing an Income Tax Return (ITR) under the old regime varies based on age groups. Here are the specific limits:Individuals below 60 years:  ₹2.5 lakhSenior citizens (aged 60 to 80 years):  ₹3 lakhSuper senior citizens (above 80 years):  ₹5 lakhIn contrast to the old regime, the new tax regime sets a uniform filing threshold of  ₹3 lakh for individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), and other individuals (excluding companies and firms).Nevertheless, filing an ITR becomes mandatory if your total income exceeds the basic exemption threshold. When income is below this limit, certain types of income such as capital gains or earnings from foreign assets might require filing an ITR.The nature of income significantly influences the criteria for filing ITR, regardless of whether your total income is below the basic exemption limit. Below is an explanation of how capital gains and foreign assets can necessitate the filing of an ITR:Capital gains: Even if your total income is below the limit, you may still need to file an ITR if you have capital gains during the year. Capital gains are taxed separately and can increase your taxable income beyond the exemption limit, necessitating the filing of an ITR. For those unfamiliar, capital gains tax applies to the profit earned from the sale of capital assets such as stocks, mutual funds, or real estate.In India, capital gains undergo varying tax treatments based on the investment duration. Short-term capital gains (assets held for less than a year) are taxed at a flat rate determined by the asset class. On the other hand, long-term capital gains (assets held for more than a year) may qualify for exemptions or reduced tax rates. However, it remains essential to file an ITR to report them accurately.Foreign assets: Foreign assets can compel the filing of an ITR even if there is no taxable income in India. Resident Indians are mandated by the Income Tax Department to declare their foreign assets using Schedule FA within their ITR forms.This disclosure encompasses various categories of foreign holdings such as bank accounts, investments (stocks, mutual funds), and immovable property (real estate). This requirement for disclosure assists tax authorities in ensuring transparency and compliance. Failure to disclose foreign assets can lead to significant penalties, including substantial fines and potential imprisonment.Filing an ITR is essential to claim tax refunds, such as excess tax deducted at source (TDS) on your income. Even if your total income is below the taxable limit, filing an ITR can be advantageous to claim:Excess TDS refund: If the total TDS deducted during the financial year exceeds your actual tax liability, you can claim a tax refund. Filing an ITR is the sole method to request this refund.Tax deductions and exemptions: Throughout the year, you may have incurred expenses that qualify for tax deductions. Filing an ITR enables you to avail of these deductions, potentially lowering your tax liability and facilitating a refund.Essentially, filing an ITR ensures accurate tax payment and enables you to claim benefits such as refunds from excess TDS or tax deductions.What is a Nil ITR and who should file it?A Nil ITR refers to an income tax return filed when the taxpayer’s income does not exceed the taxable limit or when all income has been offset by deductions, resulting in no tax liability. It serves as an official document that informs the Income Tax Department about your financial status for that particular year, even if no tax was paid.What are the benefits of filing a Nil ITR?Many taxpayers question the usefulness of filing a Nil ITR, considering it a futile exercise. However, there are numerous benefits associated with filing it.Claiming tax refunds: Even if you have no taxable income, TDS may have been deducted on certain earnings such as bank interest. Filing a Nil ITR enables you to request a refund for this excess TDS.Support Visa applications: Proof of income is often required for visa applications in many countries. A Nil ITR can serve as valid documentation in these cases.Carry forward capital losses: Filing a Nil ITR allows you to carry forward any capital losses incurred during the year. These losses can be offset against future capital gains, potentially reducing your tax liability in subsequent years.Loan applications: Banks and financial institutions frequently require ITRs as proof of income during the processing of loan applications. A Nil ITR can satisfy this requirement.Overall, although filing a Nil ITR is not obligatory for everyone, it provides valuable benefits and assists in maintaining a clear record with the tax authorities.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T16:25:21+05:30"},

Gyanchandani", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/ca-rohit-j.-gyanchandani", "Content": "There is a famous saying, \"A pet is a man's best friend.\" This is absolutely true, isn't it?Pets love us unconditionally with all their heart and soul. All they want is our love and care. So, when it comes to their health and wellness, why not take some extra steps? The best option is getting pet insurance.Pet insurance is a special type of insurance for various animals that safeguards their overall health and well-being. Just as we buy health insurance for ourselves and our loved ones, pet insurance has become a great way to ensure our pets receive the medical and financial help they may need.With annual routine expenses for animals rising, being a pet parent can be costly. Vaccinations, tick treatments, grooming, and other care can cost anywhere from  ₹10,000 to  ₹54,000 annually. Among these, vet fees and medical or surgical costs are often the highest if your pet requires such care. With a pet insurance policy, your pets can receive the best medical and legal assistance in case of unexpected situations.Benefits of pet insurance1. Financial safety - Pet insurance acts as a safety net to cover costly expenses that may arise when your pet falls ill or requires urgent medical treatment.2. Protection from unforeseen mishaps - Your furry friend may meet with an accident unexpectedly. A pet health insurance policy can cover such unforeseen circumstances, saving you from significant financial burdens.3. Exclusive benefits - Many pet insurance companies offer exclusive benefits, such as coverage for damages your pet may cause to third parties or their property. Additionally, these policies can be helpful if your pet gets lost or stolen.4. Regular health check-ups - Certain plans provide free annual health check-ups, helping you maintain your pet’s health without worrying about the cost of regular medical visits.5. Special and modern treatments - Pet insurance can cover special and modern treatments, which can otherwise be very expensive.6. Global coverage - Some plans offer global coverage, which is useful when travelling abroad with your pet. They cover any mishaps that might occur during your trip.Types of pet insuranceWhile insurance companies in India have long offered cattle and livestock insurance, private-sector insurers now provide comprehensive pet insurance covering not only death but also expenses like worldwide transit, third-party liabilities, theft or loss of pets, entry fees for dog shows, and more. Here are the main types of pet insurance plans available:Dog insurance: The most common pet insurance in India. With an estimated 28-29 million pets in India, dogs constitute a significant portion. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, this number has risen as many people have turned to dogs for companionship. Most pet insurance plans are designed for dog owners, offering protection against various risks and ensuring the safety and health of their beloved pets.Cat insurance: Cats are cherished pets, and many insurance providers now offer plans specifically for cat owners. Cat insurance protects your feline friend from the risks of her adventurous nature and ensures her overall well-being. These plans provide coverage for accidents, illnesses, and other health-related expenses.Pet insurance providers in IndiaThe following companies provide various insurance policies for pets in India:Bajaj Allianz Pet Dog Insurance PolicyFuture Generali India Dog Health InsuranceThe New India Assurance Dog Insurance PolicyThe Oriental Insurance Dog InsuranceDigit Pet Insurance Policy (covers both dogs and cat, but planning to launch soon)Pet insurance inclusionsThe range of benefits varies with the insurer as well as the cost of the premium. Here are some common coverages provided under pet insurance:1. Surgery expenses cover - Covers the cost of surgeries needed due to accidents or illnesses.2. Death due to accident/diseases - Provides financial compensation in case your pet dies due to an accident or illness.3. Hospitalisation cover - Covers the cost of hospitalisation for your pet in case of severe illness or injury.4. OPD cover - Covers outpatient department expenses, including routine check-ups and minor treatments.5. Lost or stolen pets - Provides financial compensation if your pet is lost or stolen.Pet insurance exclusionsIn some cases, the insurer does not cover medical expenses. These exclusions typically include:1. Non-essential surgeries - Surgeries that are not necessitated by illness or accident.2. Congenital defects - Surgeries to cure deformities or congenital defects.3. Pregnancy-related surgeries - Surgeries performed due to pregnancy or whelping.4. Grooming-related surgeries - Any surgery related to grooming.5. Cosmetic or elective surgeries - Surgeries not related to an injury, including cosmetic procedures.6. Non-accidental dental surgeries - Dental surgeries not caused by an accident or injury.Eligibility for pet insuranceEligibility criteria for pet insurance depend on the insurer. Typically, you can buy pet insurance for pets aged between 2 months to 10 years. For dogs, insurance can be purchased for indigenous, cross-bred, and exotic breeds. Note that the premium of the insurance plan will vary based on the age, breed, and size of the dog.In conclusion, just like you, your furry friend needs health coverage too. With pet insurance for dogs and cats, you can cover most medical expenses that may arise, helping your finances stay intact from unforeseen costs.If you have a pet or plan to get one, don't miss out on affordable pet insurance. Compare pet insurance prices, applicable conditions, inclusions, and exclusions of various plans, and choose the one that suits you best.Rohit Gyanchandani is Managing Director at Nandi Nivesh Private Limited&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T09:14:09+05:30"},

A Special Opportunities Fund is no exception.Edited Excerpts:With the market in froth and experts asking investors to be careful of the hype, is this the right time to look for special opportunities to invest in?The market is currently at valuation multiples which may not be called attractive, more so, for mid caps and small caps where the valuation premiums are above long-term averages. We don’t see a case for multiple expansions over the next couple of years (especially for mid caps and small caps). In this scenario, Alpha generation would come along with unique opportunities where you may see a case for both earnings growth accelerating and the scope of valuation multiples expanding. This fund seeks to invest in these very special opportunities. So, yes, we do think that this is the right time for such a fund.You will be managing a “Special Opportunities Fund”. What according to you comprise special opportunities?Special opportunities can come in any form. It can be by way of (a) policy changes in India and abroad, (b) mergers and acquisitions, (c) demergers, (d) management change, etc. There are further opportunities to look at operating leverage turning into financial leverage, industry consolidation, buyback, etc. So, the canvas is pretty wide to look across the market for such opportunities.What type of investor is best suited for Special Opportunities Funds? Are there specific financial goals or risk tolerances that align particularly well with these funds?Equity investment is always accompanied by higher risk and related volatility. This fund is no different in that case. However, when you are focusing on bottom-up stock picking, you look at a disproportionate risk-reward scenario loaded in your favour.The last AMFI data underlined investors making a beeline for thematic funds. What is your view on the same?Thematic funds generally have a much focused approach towards a particular sector or theme. These are hence used as a flavour to the overall equity exposure when an investor wants to play a specific theme more than any other. These funds, if used proactively, can add potential alpha to a client’s portfolio return.&nbsp;More investors are moving to equity investments. What is your advice to them?Equity investments are a good tool for long-term capital appreciation. They have become a great source of long-term gains over the last many years. This also results in money being more productively used for a country’s growth and reap rewards over the long term.What people see in equity investment is returns. What gets missed out is ‘Risk’ because it’s unseen.In the market, it’s always important to have a view on both risk and return and then move ahead. Many times investors just focus on the return part and that is the time mistakes happen. Moreover, it’s always better to seek professional advice while investing in equity markets. Just remember, “There are no free lunches”.Do you have reason to believe that the coming back of the incumbent government may prompt investors to invest majorly in equities and ignore the significance of fixed-income instruments?A stable government with a growth orientation is something all investors ask for. So, yes, the coming back of the incumbent government is rekindling the hopes of investors of policy reforms continuation and acceleration in coming years. We are also seeing flows into the equity market increasing post the government formation. However, it would be wrong to say that investors are ignoring fixed-income instruments as we are seeing deposits increase as well. So, investors are looking at both asset classes, though the noise around equity investments is a bit more in the current scenario.How much allocation do you advise to equities for investors looking to create a sizable corpus in the long run, say 20-25 years?Investors who don’t need money for the next 20-25 years should have a sizable allocation towards equity. This will surely help her create a nest egg for her future needs. However, there is no one rule which fits everybody. It all depends on your cash flows and risk profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T10:31:12+05:30"},

Economic Times reported how this oversight also led to additional interest and penalties due to the supposed non-payment.Dr. Bhalla’s creditworthiness was severely affected by the incident, hampering his access to credit. He pursued legal recourse and successfully resolved the case. This situation is not unique, as many individuals frequently suffer from credit card issues caused by errors and unnecessary complications, resulting in significant personal and financial repercussions.Many fail to grasp the significance of credit scores and their enduring impact on credibility. Regrettably, a strong credit score is often undervalued. Primarily, a high credit score enhances approval prospects for loans such as mortgages, car loans, and personal loans. Moreover, it secures lower interest rates, translating into substantial long-term savings. Conversely, a lower credit score yields contrasting outcomes.In the present day, understanding and managing your credit score effectively is crucial for improving your credit opportunities. However, prevalent misconceptions frequently lead to financial errors. Numerous misconceptions have been spread about it. Here are some common myths and facts about credit scores to guide you in effective credit management:Myths surrounding credit scoreChecking your credit score lowers it: Many people mistakenly believe that checking your credit score can lower it. However, in reality, checking your credit score is considered a soft inquiry and does not affect your credit score. It’s only when lenders perform hard inquiries, typically during credit applications, that your score might experience a slight, temporary dip.Getting rid of your old accounts improves your score: Closing an old account with a good credit history can negatively impact your score in several ways. Firstly, credit bureaus consider your average credit age, which reflects the length of time your credit accounts have been open. Closing an older account reduces this average, potentially lowering your score.Likewise, closing a credit card reduces your overall available credit limit. Continuing to spend the same amount on credit will increase your credit utilization ratio, which may lower your credit score.High income equates to a high credit score: Your income contributes to your eligibility for credit, yet it isn’t the predominant factor shaping your credit score. Your credit score hinges primarily on how responsibly you handle credit, such as ensuring timely payments and maintaining a low credit utilization ratio. These behaviors showcase your adeptness in managing credit prudently.Having a consistent income enhances your ability to repay loans, although it doesn’t directly influence your credit score. However, fluctuations in income could result in missed payments, thereby impacting your score negatively.Repayment of debt, even if left, improves your credit score: Paying off debt does not automatically remove it from your credit report. After you’ve settled a debt, it can stay on your credit report for up to seven years from the charge-off date, when the creditor stops pursuing payment. Nevertheless, there is a silver lining: even after a delinquency, consistently making timely payments on the debt following its charge-off can gradually boost your credit score. This underscores your dedication to prudent credit management.Using a debit card contributes to building credit: That’s a common misunderstanding. Debit cards work by deducting funds directly from your checking account, so they don’t involve borrowing and repaying money like credit cards do. Because credit bureaus monitor your borrowing and repayment behaviors to evaluate your creditworthiness, debit card transactions are not reported to them and thus do not affect your credit score directly.There is only one credit score model: You don’t have only one single credit score. There exist various credit scoring models, with the most prominent being FICO and VantageScore. These models might assign slightly different weights to factors such as payment history and credit utilization, leading to slight variations in your credit score.Each of the three primary credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) maintains your credit report and computes your score based on the information in their possession. While the data they gather is generally consistent, slight discrepancies can occur, resulting in minor score variations among the bureaus.Facts that debunk credit score mythsYou must monitor your credit score regularly: Consistently keeping track of your credit score is essential for maintaining strong financial health. Errors occasionally occur, and inaccurate information may inadvertently appear on your credit report. Regularly checking your score enables you to detect these inaccuracies early and promptly dispute them with the credit bureau.Keeping an eye on your credit score can assist in identifying indications of identity theft or fraudulent actions. If you notice unfamiliar accounts or inquiries on your report, you can take immediate action to resolve them. Also, frequently checking your score enables you to observe its progress as you responsibly manage your credit. This progress can serve as a strong motivator to stay committed to your financial objectives.Payment history is the most significant factor: Your credit score is most heavily influenced by your payment history. Consistently making timely payments is the most reliable indicator of your creditworthiness to lenders. It showcases your capability to handle debt responsibly and fulfill loan obligations as agreed. By making on-time payments a priority across all your credit commitments, you can markedly enhance your credit score and open up improved financial prospects down the road.You must focus on your credit utilization ratio: Your credit utilization ratio plays a crucial role in determining your credit score. The credit utilization ratio shows the proportion of your available credit limit that you are currently utilizing. A lower ratio indicates responsible credit management and avoids overextension. Typically, maintaining a credit utilization ratio below 30% is recommended for achieving a good credit score. However, ratios below 10% can be even more advantageous.You can improve your poor credit score: A poor credit score does not signify the end of possibilities. Improving your score hinges on practising responsible credit management, such as consistently paying all bills on time, including credit cards, loans, and utilities.Building and enhancing your credit score requires patience and consistency in practising responsible credit management. By staying diligent, you’ll experience gradual improvement over time. It’s also important to regularly review your credit report for errors and promptly dispute any inaccuracies with the credit bureaus.Your credit score holds significance beyond just obtaining loans: Your credit score impacts more than just your ability to secure loans. It can also affect other financial aspects such as insurance premiums, rental agreements, utility bills, and other decisions surrounding finances.Understanding these myths and facts empowers you to make informed decisions in building and sustaining a healthy credit score, ultimately enhancing your financial well-being over time. A good credit score not only reflects your financial responsibility but also unlocks opportunities across different facets of your life. By recognizing the significance of your credit score and implementing effective management strategies, you can lay the groundwork for a more stable and prosperous financial future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T10:56:57+05:30"},

Tiwari, national general secretary, TUCC.\"The benefits that workers get from these schemes are not adequate, so we proposed an increase corresponding to the inflation in the country,\" Tiwari added.The allocation for welfare schemes (Central sector and Centrally sponsored schemes combined) in the FY25 interim budget announced in February was increased by just 4.7% over the revised estimates for FY24.According to the India Employment Report 2024, jointly published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Institute of Human Development (IHD) in March, the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), Worker Population Ratio (WPR), and the Unemployment Rate (UR) witnessed a sustained decline between 2000 and 2018, but showed signs of improvement post-2019.Meanwhile, wages&nbsp;have largely remained stagnant or declined, with real wages for regular workers and self-employed individuals showing a negative trend after 2019.

The Opposition bloc has 234 legislators in the lower House of Parliament.With numbers in favour of the NDA, Om Birla is set to become the Lok Sabha Speaker for a second term.

They [Opposition] are going to contest against us although we have the numbers, but this is against the Parliamentary traditions.”Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said, “The Speaker is elected unanimously.

The lab is adopting a new structure that’ll enable its projects to more easily spin out of X as independent startups with support from Alphabet and outside backers, according to one of the people and an email to staff obtained by Bloomberg.X seeks bold approaches to major challenges like climate change and connectivity, but its efforts have yielded few durable businesses thus far.“We’re expanding our approach to focus on spinning out more projects as independent companies funded through market-based capital,” Astro Teller, who leads to lab, wrote in the email. “We’ll do this by opening our scope to collaborate with a broader base of industry and financial partners, and by continuing to emphasize lean teams and capital efficiency.”As part of the restructuring, X is laying off dozens of employees, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. The layoffs are focused on support staff, the person said. Alphabet didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.  ;Launched by Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, X has captured the public imagination by pursuing projects from self-driving cars to high-altitude balloons that connect remote communities to the internet. But in recent years the lab has come under more pressure to show that it can turn its speculative bets into profitable businesses, and Alphabet as a whole is waging a campaign to cut costs.This month, Google eliminated hundreds of jobs on teams including hardware and engineering, with more cuts potentially on the way as it sharpens its focus on artificial intelligence. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who has sought to instill greater financial discipline, is moving into a new role as president and chief investment officer, in which she will oversee a division that includes X.“She will put more heat into the kitchen and help drive success and viable businesses,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in an email.Since Google reorganized itself as a conglomerate in 2015, X’s moonshots have sought to “graduate” as Other Bets, or independent ventures under the banner of parent company Alphabet. But Alphabet could only accommodate so many Other Bets, creating a bottleneck for X ventures that were ready to take the next step, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. Startups within X often faced a choice between waiting for a spot to open up or striking out on their own.X employees had explored raising outside capital for their ventures in the past, but they ran into concerns from Alphabet leadership, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.In addition to seeking venture capital, X has met with family offices, sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms and strategic investors, or companies operating in the same industries that the moonshots are targeting, according to the people.Silicon Valley’s innovation labs have come under threat in a time of layoffs and budget cuts. Last year, Google slashed most jobs at Area 120, an in-house startup incubator. X cut some jobs last year but has refrained from making more significant changes until now.“This approach will give us more opportunity to focus on what Xers do best: inventing breakthrough technologies to help solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges,” Teller wrote in the note to staff. “Because the world needs moonshots more now than ever.” ;", "Published_Date": "2024-01-22T21:35:43+05:30"},

But it’s not all bad", "Author": "Devina Sengupta", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/devina-sengupta", "Content": "Mumbai: Annual appraisals may fetch an average pay hike of 9.5% this year while top performers stand to win 1.74 times more, a survey of employers found, in an indication of companies going the extra mile to retain top talent.This will also be the lowest pay hike since 2021, when the average increase was 9.3%. Last year, companies had given an average hike of 9.7%, the survey by consulting firm Aon showed. Even though pay hikes may be on similar lines as last year, it may make a bigger difference this year, Aon said, pointing to the decline in inflation. The real wage growth (salary increase minus inflation) this year will be 4.9%, against last year’s 4.2%, it said.“In 2023, organizations navigated a challenging environment, balancing a generous average salary increment amid high attrition rates. As leaders prepare for 2024, their focus is likely to shift towards building a supportive work environment to foster employee engagement in a dynamic job market,” said Jang Bahadur Singh, Aon’s director for Talent Solutions. Aon surveyed 1,414 companies from almost 45 industries for its study titled Annual Salary Increase and Turnover Survey 2023-24, India.Aon’s is the year’s first survey on compensation, usually followed by similar studies from Deloitte and Mercer.While the Indian economy clocked surprising growth of 7.6% in the second quarter, prompting the government and the central bank to increase their projections for the year, interest rates remain high, and many companies in the startup and tech sectors have had to reduce headcount and pause hiring as a funding winter dragged on.Pay hikes at nearly the same levels as last year come in the backdrop of global economic sluggishness and a tempering of hiring sentiments in the private sector. However, easing inflationary pressures will lead to more cash in the employee’s pockets after the hikes, Aon said.Non-bank lenders may be the most generous with pay hikes this year, handing out an average 11.1% raise. This is followed by manufacturing companies with 10.1%, life sciences and financial institutions (9.9%), and global capability centres (9.8%). E-commerce firms and IT services, which had waged a talent war in 2022, are expected to roll out hikes of 9.2% and 8.2%, respectively.According to the founder of an education-based fintech and NBFC (non-banking finance company), getting good product managers and compliance experts is hard. “If we have to recruit a mid-level product manager who was earning  ₹30 lakh, we will offer  ₹60 lakh at least,” the founder said.Private lenders are also facing challenges in retaining talent. The human resources chief of one of the three largest private banks commented that employee costs are so high that his bank is forced to reduce campus hiring and focus on in house-talent.Despite the macro-economic headwinds, many companies are betting on domestic demand and those that are little exposed to the US and Europe are faring better. In February, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) monetary policy committee (MPC) kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged for the sixth straight time, citing persistent risks from food inflation and incomplete transmission of monetary policy. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das highlighted that the “last mile of disinflation” towards the 4% inflation target is the most challenging, signalling that rate cuts may not be imminent.“The projected increase in salaries in the Indian formal sector indicates a strategic adjustment in response to the evolving economic landscape. Despite a conservative global sentiment, industries such as infrastructure and manufacturing continue to project robust growth, indicating the need for targeted investments in certain sectors,” said Roopank Chaudhary, partner and chief commercial officer for Talent Solutions at Aon in India.In retail, where employee performance is more accurately measured given the target-oriented profiles, high performers can earn pay hikes that are 2.01x of their regular counterparts. At professional services, the corresponding figure is 1.78x.“We rolled out 10% average hike last year and our top performers got 1.5x-1.7x more. This year, hikes are in a similar range, while we will offer better raises to high performers in technical and special roles in mining and those in digital skills,” said Praveen Purohit, deputy chief human resources officer, Vedanta Group.Aon data showed that overall attrition fell from 21.4% in 2022 to 18.7% in 2023, as the hiring frenzy of the pandemic years was followed by a freeze. According to the consultant, external inequity in compensation; limited growth opportunities; and personal reasons which could include location, need for more flexibility, role stagnation are among the top four reasons to exit a firm. Issues with the manager and internal pay parity struggles are two other important factors that have become more critical over the last three years, as employees turn more vocal about their personal well-being.", "Published_Date": "2024-02-21T13:55:32+05:30"},

Our initiatives hinge on creating a trusted brand to attract, develop and retain top notch talent, and being aligned with purpose and business strategy and ultimately success as a company to be able to create client impact,” says Pooja Mehtani, General Counsel, ;Sun Life ;Global Solutions.To promote DEI&B (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging), organisations must prioritise listening to employees, understanding their needs, and aligning benefits accordingly. Creating diverse and inclusive environments unlocks opportunities for varied perspectives to drive collective progress.The broader question for firms today is defining DEI — is it solely about boosting female representation? DEI extends beyond that, aiming for social justice, equality, and inclusive environments where diversity is celebrated, equity is ensured, and inclusion is standard. GCCs, with their diverse workforce from various backgrounds, facilitate collaboration and innovation. Embracing this diversity is vital for nurturing an inclusive workplace culture.On DEI implementation at SLGS, Pooja says: “Last year was a year of many \"firsts\" in SLGS from a DEI perspective. We are expanding the definition of diversity beyond gender – generational diversity, acquired diversity, and hiring PwD in India. We are also revisiting some policies, designing sponsorship and leadership programs for women, setting up a DEI council, broadening DEI to include belonging, and there’s so much more. At SLGS, we are building a culture that truly inspires continuous learning and strengthens our collective potential and leadership through empowerment. Some of the departmental engagement programs at SLGS are the Employee Resource Groups, to champion and support our DE&I initiatives. These groups provide safe spaces for employees with shared backgrounds, experiences, or interests. They play a vital role in fostering inclusion, raising awareness, and driving positive change within the organisation. Leadership Programmes equip our leaders with the necessary awareness and skills to be more inclusive in their leadership styles. Additionally, we have implemented programmes such as STRIDE, L.E.A.P and Sunrise specifically designed for women leaders. We are integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) commitments into crucial talent practices and decisions with our Talent practices Integration. This ensures that DE&I considerations are embedded in across talent management process including recruitment, promotion and performance evaluation.”Initiatives often falter if firms don’t cultivate a sense of Belonging among employees — feeling valued, respected, and part of a bigger picture. Activities fostering this belonging unleash the true potential of diverse individuals at work.“Employee Resource Groups can become an integral part of DEI&B initiatives. At SLGS, SunStree (an Employee Resource Group for women) was launched in 2022 as a a platform to create a strong network for our women employees. This platform is focused on identifying and addressing workplace challenges faced by women, providing developmental opportunities for their advancement, and creating an open and interactive learning space. Additionally, SunStree also emphasises the health and well-being of women employees. Expanding the definition of diversity we have expanded ERGs with WomenInTech and WorkingFamilies to advance inclusion with collaborative efforts of 8 ERGs across SLGS,” says Pooja.While India’s female labour force participation has risen, challenges persist, with the country ranking 135th in the Global Gender Gap Index. However, initiatives like SEBI’s mandate for women representation on corporate boards signal progress. Globalisation has also expanded opportunities, transcending geographical boundaries for talent acquisition.DEI&B is not just a destination but a continuous journey towards building inclusive workplace cultures that unleash the full potential of diverse talent. Through concerted efforts and commitment, organisations can drive societal change and pave the way for a more equitable and inclusive future.", "Published_Date": "2024-02-22T22:39:06+05:30"},

The new corporate trend has left many employees in the lurch. ;The ‘dry promotion’ is referred to as a practice where an employee gets a promotion in the job but not a salary hike.ALSO READ: Average salary appraisals in IT sector projected between 8.4% to 9% in 2024In simple words, it can be explained as in ‘dry promotion’ an employee’s designation changes and workload increases, but the monetary compensation remains the same.Recently, a report by compensation consultant Pearl Meyer revealed that more than 13 per cent of employers chose to give their staff new job titles instead of a hike in salary. In 2018, this number was only 8 per cent, reported The Wall Street Journal.Separately, a report by benefits-advisory firm Mercer said that a survey of 900 companies showed that more employers are assigning less of their salary budgets for promotion-related hikes in 2024 when compared to 2023.Some employers also look at ‘dry promotion’ as an opportunity to redistribute the responsibilities of laid-off workers to their existing employees without raising their cost-to-company (CTC) package. ;ALSO READ: ;How to manage your anticipated salary appraisals?New strategy to retain talentThe report shows that many companies are increasingly relying more on job titles in their strategies to retain talent.The increasing trend of ‘dry promotion’ can also be attributed to the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is impacting organisational structure, change management, and employees’ roles.“Thirty per cent of respondents have added AI as an additional area of responsibility to an existing executive role, and 9 per cent have either promoted an executive from within or made an external hire.

According to the Mint+Shine Talent Insights report, 34% of the HR executives surveyed said they expected a hike of that range, possibly targeted to boost employee morale and prevent them from changing loyalties.More than 3,000 HR executives and job seekers were surveyed during the quarterly study conducted during the January-March period. Around 49% of the recruiters expressed a positive sentiment about the upcoming appraisal cycle.Another sizeable segment of recruiters, roughly 25%, is planning more moderate raises of 6-8%.

This shows job seekers and employees were hopeful of even bigger hikes than employers expect to give this year.The proposed increments come at a time India Inc has over the last year seen hiring numbers drastically cut down. During 2021 and early 2022, firms across sectors hired at a breakneck speed to transform their traditional businesses into digital ones. But since the second half of 2022, macro-economic sluggishness, geopolitical tensions, and private equity firms dialling down their investments had impacted IT, startup and retail industries.Read also: Dry promotion: ’New title, no raise’ appraisal trend leaves employees in a pickleAnnual appraisals may fetch an average pay hike of 9.5% this year while top performers stand to win 1.74 times more, according to a study by consulting firm Aon.

The increments would follow a similar pattern as the previous year,\" said Ruchira Bhardwaja, chief human resources officer at Kotak Life.According to the Mint+Shine study, just 2% of the recruiters anticipate minimal raises of 0-2%. This comes on the back of economic challenges faced in certain industries and budget constraints limiting their ability to offer better increments.However, even with stringent budgets, companies are ensuring that the top performers get a prominently higher raise and that can go as much as 1.7-1.8 times the average increment.Read also: Average salary appraisals in Indian IT sector projected between 8.4% to 9% in 2024Companies like Tata Steel made changes in their appraisal process and organizational bands to offer more opportunities to their top performers.

Through this policy, sub-bands have been introduced within the junior to middle management levels to provide additional opportunities for career progression based on certain eligibility criteria.“…additional opportunities are provided to eligible high performing officers who can apply for next level opportunities and can get promoted in a fast-track manner within the organisation,” said Atrayee Sanyal, vice president, Human Resource Management, Tata Steel, in an email response to Mint.Promotions are another tool that are widely used to halt exits. “With the introduction of sub-banding and ACE we have observed a 40% dip in the attrition rate of high performers from that of the previous year,” Sanyal saidBut rolling out promotions at large scale without looking into the impact within the team may backfire.“While promotions can serve as a tool for retaining talent, they should be equitable, merit-based, and integrated into a comprehensive talent strategy,” said Akhil Gupta, chief executive, Shine.com. Gupta noted that leveraging AI-driven analytics to augment the appraisal process can enable more precise evaluations.But managing high potential will remain a challenge.

All you need to know | Mint", "Author": "Livemint", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/livemint", "Content": "YouTube Music is reportedly gearing up to introduce a new AI-powered feature, according to recent reports. The music streaming service, operated by Google, had earlier launched the Play, Sing, or Hum to Search function that leverages AI to help users find songs. The next anticipated innovation, allegedly named ‘Ask for Music’, might incorporate a generative AI chatbot to enable song searches via conversational language.Insights into the 'Ask for Music' feature were uncovered during a teardown of the YouTube Music app for Android, specifically version 7.06.53, as reported by Android Authority. Several lines of code within the app suggested the development of this new AI-driven tool. The feature appears to be experimental, as indicated by various code strings.The feature is described both as its name and as an initial on-screen prompt when accessed. A disclaimer found within the code warns users that “AI-generated responses are experimental. Quality and accuracy may vary. Please don't enter confidential or personal information regarding yourself or others.” Additionally, a submit button is referenced, suggesting a user interaction component.Although the exact functionality remains uncertain, the inclusion of AI-generated responses and a prompt implies that the feature could operate similarly to a chatbot. Users may be able to ask questions about songs, artists, and albums in a conversational manner, with the AI providing information and possibly linking to relevant songs and albums.Currently, YouTube Music incorporates a few AI-based features. These include an audio-based search accessible via a waveform icon on the top-right corner of the screen and an AI-generated playlist cover that creates images for user-made playlists. If 'Ask for Music' is implemented, it would represent the platform’s first comprehensive AI feature.However, it is important to note that app teardowns often reveal features that may be far from release or might never see the light of day. Sometimes, developers leave code for unreleased or abandoned features within the app, making it premature to confirm whether 'Ask for Music' will become available to users.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-20T22:08:41+05:30"},

Last year's iQOO 12 impressed with its speed, camera capabilities, and long battery life, and the iQOO 13 promises to surpass it with several significant enhancements.Tipster Digital Chat Station has revealed that the iQOO 13 will feature a flat OLED panel boasting a 2K resolution, a step up from the 1.5K AMOLED display of the iQOO 12. Contrary to earlier speculations about a curved screen, the flat design will be retained. The phone will also introduce a single-point ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor, enhancing security and ease of use.Under the hood, the iQOO 13 is expected to house the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset, set to be a staple in upcoming flagship devices such as the OnePlus 13 and Xiaomi 15. This powerhouse will likely be paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage, ensuring top-tier performance.Battery life is another area where the iQOO 13 is poised to excel, with rumors suggesting a substantial 6,000mAh capacity, a notable increase from the iQOO 12's 5,000mAh. Charging technology is also set to improve, with reports hinting at 100W fast charging, though some sources suggest it might support 120W. Additionally, the iQOO 13 could introduce 50W wireless charging, a feature not present in its predecessor.Photography enthusiasts have reason to be excited as well. The iQOO 13 is rumored to feature a triple-camera system with three 50-megapixel sensors: a main sensor, an ultrawide lens, and a 3x periscope telephoto camera. This setup represents an upgrade from the iQOO 12, which had a 64-megapixel telephoto sensor.Gamers will benefit from an oversized x-axis linear motor, enhancing haptic feedback and gaming performance. The iQOO 13 is also expected to come with an IP68 rating, offering better water and dust resistance compared to the iQOO 12's IP64 rating.In a surprising move, there might not be a Pro variant this time around, with the standard iQOO 13 model set to deliver these impressive features. As the launch date approaches, tech enthusiasts eagerly await official confirmation of these specifications and further details on what promises to be a standout device in the smartphone market.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-21T15:20:02+05:30"},

The new language model comes with a 200K token context window, which translates to around 1,50,000 words.Also Read | After ChatGPT, is Gemini coming to iPhones next? Top Apple Executive says ‘look forward to integrating…’In terms of real-world use, Anthropic says Claude 3.5 is better at understanding nuance, humour and complex instructions, while also offering a more natural and relatable tone in its writing. Coding skills are also said to have improved dramatically, with Anthropic stating that Claude 3.5 Sonnet can independently write, edit and execute code with \"sophisticated reasoning and troubleshooting capabilities\".Claude 3.5 Sonnet is also said to have improved vision capabilities. Anthropic says Claude will now be able to better understand charts and graphs, while also accurately transcribing text from \"imperfect images\". The new performance boost, says Anthropic, makes Claude 3.5 Sonnet ideal for handling complex tasks such as customer support and orchestrating multi-step workflows.Perhaps the most interesting part of the announcement was the introduction of a new feature called Artifacts. This is a dedicated window that opens alongside the chat window and allows users to get a real-time idea of what they are creating. For example, if users ask Claude to write an email for them, they will now get a window alongside the normal screen where they can edit the message in real time.In the future, Anthropic also plans to create a shared workspace for organisations where they can centralise their knowledge and documents in one place by taking advantage of the Artifacts feature.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-21T16:26:12+05:30"},

The new iteration, dubbed \"Remarkable Alexa,\" is expected to significantly enhance the assistant's capabilities. Eight current and former employees involved with Alexa, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, shared these details.The report adds that Amazon is pushing for an August deadline for the latest Alexa version, with CEO Andy Jassy personally invested in the project's success. In a recent shareholder letter, Jassy hinted at a “more intelligent and capable Alexa,” without disclosing further specifics. However, insiders warn that the plans, including pricing and release schedules, could change based on the progress of Project Banyan.An Amazon spokeswoman told Reuters, \"We have already integrated generative AI into different components of Alexa and are working hard on implementation at scale—in the over half a billion ambient, Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world—to enable even more proactive, personal, and trusted assistance for our customers.\"Originally a passion project of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alexa was envisioned to emulate the fictional voice computer from Star Trek. The service, which provides spoken responses to user queries and can control home appliances, has yet to turn a profit. Some employees see Project Banyan as a crucial attempt to revive Alexa amid increasing competition from Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI’s chatbots, which have gained significant attention for their advanced conversational abilities.Amazon's restructuring efforts, including significant layoffs in late 2023, reflect the challenges faced by Alexa. Primarily accessed via Amazon TVs and Echo speakers, Alexa remains popular for simple tasks like setting timers, checking the weather, playing music, or answering basic questions. However, its potential to drive e-commerce sales has not materialized as expected, partly because users prefer to see and compare products visually.(With inputs from Reuters)&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-21T16:48:27+05:30"},

Notably, these virtual objects would persist in the user’s space even after Safari was closed.Reportedly,&nbsp;Apple has implemented stringent security measures to control what can enter a user’s personal space within Vision Pro. Typically, native apps operate within a “Shared Space” environment, ensuring predictable behavior and easy closure. For a more immersive experience, apps must obtain explicit user permission through an OS-level prompt, granting them access to a “Full Space” context. This permission model also extends to websites, maintaining a high level of security for the user.The report adds that Apple overlooked an augmented reality feature introduced in 2018. This feature, part of WebKit and present in the Vision Pro build, involves the AR Kit Quick Look – a method for rendering 3D Pixar files using HTML in iOS.&nbsp;This standard supports modern file types like Apple’s .reality format and includes Spatial Audio, enhancing the realism of the 3D objects. These features are enabled by default and do not require user activation of experimental settings.The critical oversight was that Safari did not enforce any permission model for this feature. Moreover, the feature could be activated through programmatic JavaScript clicking without any user interaction, added the report.&nbsp;Consequently, visiting a malicious website could result in the user’s room being filled with numerous animated and sound-producing 3D objects instantly, creating a potentially alarming situation.The cybersecurity researcher who discovered the vulnerability highlighted this issue, showing how a simple website visit could flood a user’s space with hundreds of spiders or screeching bats. Recognizing the severity of this bug, Apple awarded the researcher an undisclosed amount as a bug bounty and has since resolved the issue, ensuring that Vision Pro users are now protected from such exploits.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-21T23:13:34+05:30"},

Users will also no longer be able to start livestreams via the X integration on the encoder platform.The news was confirmed via a post by the official ‘@live’ profile on X, which wrote, “Starting soon, only Premium subscribers will be able to livestream (create live video streams) on X. This includes going live from an encoder with X integration. Upgrade to Premium to continue going live,”Notably, all other major social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok do not require users to have a premium subscription to start a livestream.Since taking over the social media platform in 2022, Elon Musk has introduced a number of changes, including ending the old verified programme, rebranding the company from Twitter to X and removing the ability to block accounts. However, the app doesn't require a fee to use basic features such as starting a livestream, which could be a sign of things to come.With advertising revenue continuing to be a concern for X, Musk and co. are increasingly focused on growing the premium subscription model.

Apple Intelligence brings with it a host of nifty features, including a revamped Siri interface that can hold conversations for longer periods of time, Photos app makeover, integration with ChatGPT, and the ability to generate images and emoji.While most of the new AI features aren't likely to arrive this year, when they do, they'll be limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and later models. This means that even the latest iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will not get the new AI features.Apple is reportedly working on a much more powerful chipset for the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to support the new AI features in all 4 models. But the omission of the vanilla iPhone 15 models from the list of supported devices for Apple Intelligence has left many users wondering whether this was a ploy by Apple to generate more buzz and thus more sales for the iPhone 16, or whether the iPhone 15 Plus and older models are actually incapable of handling these complex tasks.Apple explains why older iPhones don't support Apple Intelligence:Thankfully, we now have some much-needed clarity on why Apple hasn't brought these AI features to older iPhones. Speaking to John Gruber of the Daring Fireball podcast, John Giannandrea (Apple's vice president of machine learning and AI strategy) revealed that while the AI models that power Apple Intelligence could theoretically run a very old device, they would be so slow that they would not be useful at all.Giannandrea said, “The inference of large language models is incredibly computationally expensive… You could in theory run these models on a very old device, but it would be so slow that it would not be useful”&nbsp;Gruber then asked other top Apple executies on the panel: Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak if the restrictions were a ‘scheme to sell new iPhones’. Responding to the assertion, Joswiak said that if that was the case, Apple would have been ‘smart enough’ to restrict new AI features to just the newly launched iPads and Macs.&nbsp;Meanwhile, addressing the issue head on, Federighi said, \"Our first move in any way is to figure out how we can bring features back as far as we can… It's a pretty extraordinary thing to run models of this power on an iPhone and it turned out it took us building this iPhone.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-22T16:11:44+05:30"},

The Biyani sisters—Avni Biyani Jhunjhunwala and Ashni Biyani—had begun their Foodhall premium food chain from Mumbai’s Palladium Mall in 2011.The Biyani sisters’ return to food retail comes on the back of rising demand for specialized foods and wellness products as well as a general uptick in premium foods. The venture is funded by a Mumbai-based family office, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Founded in 2011, the Foodhall chain operated under 10 stores in India, selling a variety of imported produce such as cheese and condiments, according to Future Retail’s annual report for FY21. By 2023, all stores were shuttered, following insolvency proceedings against parent Future Retail initiated by its creditors.Food Stories will sell gourmet foods such as cheese, condiments, fresh produce, packaged foods such as spices, oils, snacks and meats from both imported as well as homegrown brands. It will also start e-commerce operations in Delhi later this year, said another person aware of the development.Avni Biyani declined to comment when contacted. Kishore Biyani did not respond to queries sent by Mint.Increasingly, companies and brands are chasing affluent Indian consumers who are driving up sales of expensive cars, real estate and bags among others.In premium foods, too, more companies are stepping in, increasing the competitive landscape for the Biyani sisters.For instance, last year, Spencer’s Retail Ltd, an RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group subsidiary, announced its foray into upmarket grocery retail under the Nature’s Basket Artisan Pantry brand, citing demand for pricey truffle, caviar, and exotic mushrooms. The chain planned to open several stores in Mumbai and Kolkata, Shashwat Goenka, chairman, Spencer’s Retail, had said in November.Nature’s Basket Pantry aside, several metros also house local premium gourmet chains that appeal to upmarket shoppers. These include chains such as Le Marche and Modern Bazaar.Additionally, the Biyani sisters have set up Think9 Consumer Technologies, which promotes and develops digitally native brands. Think9 works with brands across consumption categories like fashion, food and wellness, beauty, and home and decor. Its portfolio comprises brands such as apparel brand Kingdom of White, Italian snacking brand Sorrentina, wellness brand The Good Bug, and personal care brand Beauty in Everything (BIE).The sisters are also set to launch another retail concept under Broadway—to “empower digital-first” brands with stores in prime malls. These experiential stores will introduce shoppers to more than 100 new-age brands and 1,000 products and trends via events and experiences, according to a job description floated by the company and a copy of which has been seen by Mint.Meanwhile, Food Stories is being set up via a separate entity. The store in Delhi, a 10,000-sq ft. retail format, will also house a 30-seater all-day dining café that showcases an organic estate-to-cup coffee programme, a luxurious single-origin chocolate experience, bespoke cheese, single-origin spices and dry fruits, farm-sourced fruits and vegetables, according to a person aware of the company’s plans.The move marks the re-entry of the family in the food retail business, after it failed to sell its debt-laden retail and consumer businesses that were adversely impacted by the pandemic.In 2020, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd announced the acquisition of Future Group’s retail, wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business for  ₹24,713 crore. However, in 2022, after a prolonged battle for ownership, Reliance Industries called off the deal. In the same year, Reliance Retail took over leases of hundreds of Future Retail stores.Meanwhile, an application for Future Retail Limited’s liquidation is still pending before the National Company Law Tribunal. FRL owes its creditors led by Bank of India over  ₹19,000 crore, according to claims submitted and approved under the insolvency process.India’s food and grocery retail market is pegged $600 billion in 2022—occupying the largest chunk of retail in India.

However, companies may double down their presence in tier-II and rural markets. So, temporary down-stocking is a clear possibility.”Health food drinks in India are primarily malt-based milk drinks that act as taste enhancers along with offering some nutrition benefits. For years, such mixes have been sold in the market to both kids and adults—making health food drinks an over $1-billion category.However, companies use different tags to market their products. For instance, Bournvita (from Mondelez) calls itself a cereal-based beverage mix, while Horlicks (from Hindustan Unilever) calls itself a malt-based food. Meanwhile, Complan (from Zydus Wellness) markets itself as a nutritional drink. Overall, they are largely marketed to consumers offering some form of nutrition.Email queries sent to Mondelez, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Danone and Zydus Wellness did not elicit a response.Analysts tracking the fast-moving consumer goods sector said the impact on the overall category may not be “big”, adding that consumers consume these knowing about their benefits and nutrition profile mentioned on the packaging.Consumers buy products based on the brands they wish to buy versus buying it under the category of “health food drinks”, said Abneesh Roy, executive director & head of research committee, Nuvama Institutional Equities. “Companies don’t label it on packaging as a health product. Some change in advertisement may be needed on a case-to-case basis. In any case, sales volumes have been slow for this category due to price hikes,” said Roy.Meanwhile, others said the advisory for removal of health drinks and beverages such as Bournvita and other drinks from the category of health drink will have a “significant impact”, potentially leading to a dip in sales and heightened regulatory scrutiny.“By asking e-commerce platforms to remove Bournvita, the government aims to limit the accessibility of products with high sugar content and misleading health claims, particularly those targeted at children,” said Alay Razvi, partner at law firm Accord Juris LLP. “It is unfortunate that the FSSAI Act does not define a healthy drink, which helps the companies to find a loophole in the act. This notification will regulate the market.”Some others said the broader market for the category has also seen a slowdown over the past several quarters in line with a slump in FMCG volumes. ;“The category has been a bit slow the last few quarters. The concerns around health have only added to it,” said Dhairyashil Patil, president, All India Consumer Products Distributors’ Federation.Last year, Mondelez was caught in a legal tussle with a food blogger, Revant Himatsingka, after the latter claimed that its brand of Bournvita contains high sugar content apart from using cancer-causing colorants. The company dismissed the claims, and the video was suspended by Himatsingka after he was served a legal notice by the chocolate maker.", "Published_Date": "2024-04-15T18:57:47+05:30"},

These larger brands tend to make better margins on quick-commerce platforms vs e-commerce due to lower discounts on the former,” analysts at Elara Securities wrote in the report dated 16 April. Quick-commerce platforms account for between 1-2% of the sales of major FMCG brands and 7-8% for smaller brands, it said.Traditional trade yields the highest profitability for FMCG brands, followed by quick commerce. Several companies such as Nestle India, Parle Products and Godrej Consumer Products have acknowledged the salience of quick commerce to their packaged foods and home-care products.“Among mid-sized FMCG brands, digital sales range between 15% and 20%, with none exceeding 20%. Currently, quick commerce accounts for roughly 40% of digital sales (for direct-to-consumer brands), a figure expected to rise to 60% in the near future with e-commerce and modern trade turning costlier for FMCG brands than quick-commerce,” the report added.The popularity of quick commerce is also set to challenge the dominance of incumbent e-commerce platforms, especially in categories such as beauty and personal care, packaged foods and apparel. This has led to greater discounting by e-commerce platforms and offline retailers in recent quarters, according to the report.“Per our checks, quick commerce may disrupt profitability of incumbents such as Nykaa (which may resort to discounting in beauty and personal care, given its likely inability to match the convenience of quick-commerce platforms). Companies such as DMart too may be slightly hit on growth, as some part (3-6% per our checks) of the monthly grocery-FMCG purchases may move to quick-commerce, led by convenience,” the report added. The shift of advertising to quick-commerce platforms has [also] hit the profitability of e-commerce platforms, straining margins, it said.However, the impact of quick commerce may be limited to metros for now, the report added. “Quick-commerce is primarily operational in metros and tier 1 markets, which is impacting the sales of traditional and e-commerce companies in these areas. However, if quick-commerce players were to extend their operations to tier 2 and tier 3, it would challenge companies such as DMart and Nykaa, and would pare sales and profitability,” it said.Traditional and e-commerce companies must therefore innovate to enable faster ordering and deliveries to compete with quick-commerce platforms, the report added.", "Published_Date": "2024-04-17T18:11:37+05:30"},

Only seven mills in Maharashtra, about 15 in Uttar Pradesh and some in Tamil Nadu are still crushing sugarcane. Crushing of sugarcane typically closes by the end of April.Retail prices of the sweetener have remained stable in the range of  ₹43-45 a kg for the past four months. As of Friday, all-India average retail sugar price  ₹44.5 per kg, 5.4% higher on year, according to data from the consumer affairs ministry.“Sugar mill prices have risen 3.5% in the last one month. We are now going to increase the sugar sales quota allotment for next month. We will allocate at least a lakh or two lakh (tonnes) more this year for May. Though retail prices have not started rising, before they reflect, we need to curb it,” Chopra told Mint.The government allocated 2.4 million tonnes of sales quota to sugar mills last May. It allocates a monthly sales quota for each sugar mill after calculating domestic consumption, which is about 2.25-2.3 million tonnes a month on average. The quota for February was 2.2 million tonnes, which was increased to 2.35 million tonnes for March, and further to 2.5 million tonnes for April in view of higher demand during Ramadan and Eid.“Mill prices have been going up for a few days as the crushing season is over. Price variation is more noticed in Maharashtra than Uttar Pradesh. Our focus is on retail price...retail prices rise after a fortnight of mill prices going up. April is about to end. We are waiting and watching. If we see a curb in price rise in the remaining 3-4 days, we will give a regular quota. If there’s a hint of a further price rise, we will increase the sales quota,” another senior official in the food ministry said on condition of anonymity. “When we have the stock, the rate must not go up. We must not let traders who are in between millers and public gain profit.”“Last month’s quota was 2.5 million tonnes. A higher quota was given keeping higher demand due to Eid in mind. Next month’s quota will be compared with last May. We will consider the quota given last May. It has no connection with the April quota. There is no festival as such in May,” the official added.The government increases the sales quota for sugar mills in months when there are festivals to ensure that sugar price remains in check.", "Published_Date": "2024-04-26T16:35:28+05:30"},

Crude oil producers charge global prices when they sell to domestic refiners.Refiners also realize global prices of auto fuels in domestic market and abroad.That leads to a situation where extraordinary prices of crude oil and sensitive fuels fetch super profits to Indian energy companies that the windfall tax targets.Domestic crude oil production in the first seven months of the current financial year also fell 3% to 15.94 million tonnes.“Primarily on account of reduced crude oil production and the reduced rate of special additional excise duty, revenue collection from excise duty has seen a moderation this fiscal,” explained R. Muralidharan, a practising lawyer and indirect tax expert.While crude oil production attracts a nominal basic excise duty, a 20% cess and national calamity contingency duty in addition to the special additional excise duty, petrol and diesel attract basic excise duty, special additional excise duty and two categories of cess.", "Published_Date": "2023-12-19T23:01:40+05:30"},

In a recent blog post, the tech giant announced changes that will come into effect starting January 26, 2024.&nbsp;These adjustments aim to streamline the Assistant's capabilities, prioritizing commonly used features and investing in technology to improve their performance, said the American tech giant.One of the major changes involves discontinuing support for certain underutilized features. Users triggering these features will receive notifications informing them that the functionalities will no longer be available after a specific date. Some of the affected features include playing and controlling audiobooks on Google Play Books with voice commands, setting or using media alarms on Assistant-enabled devices, and managing cookbooks or instructional recipe videos.Users will no longer be able to manage stopwatches on Smart Displays and Speakers with their voice, but timers and alarms can still be set. Similarly, voice commands for calling devices or broadcasting messages to Google Family Groups will be discontinued, although users can still broadcast messages to devices within their homes.Sending emails, video, or audio messages using voice commands will also be phased out, though users can still make calls and send text messages. Rescheduling events in Google Calendar through voice commands will no longer be supported, but users can schedule new events through alternative methods.Voice control for activities on Fitbit Sense and Versa 3 devices will no longer be available, requiring users to use device buttons to start, stop, pause, and resume activities. Sleep summaries will only be viewable on Google Smart Displays, with third-party smart clocks still allowing users to inquire about sleep details by voice.In addition, calls made from speakers and Smart Displays will no longer display caller IDs unless users are utilizing Duo. Ambient \"Commute to Work\" time estimates on Smart Displays will no longer be visible, but users can still ask for commute times and directions by voice. Checking personal travel itineraries by voice will also be phased out, with users encouraged to ask for flight status instead.&nbsp;Similarly, users will no longer be able to ask for information about their contacts by voice, although calls to contacts can still be made.Voice commands for certain actions, such as sending a payment, making a reservation, or posting to social media, will no longer be supported. Instead, users are encouraged to ask Assistant to open their installed apps for these tasks.In addition to feature changes, the microphone icon will now exclusively trigger search results in response to user queries, focusing on its most popular use case. Users can still activate Assistant by saying \"Hey Google\" or using the traditional long press on the home or power button. However, the microphone icon in the Search bar will no longer complete actions like turning on lights or sending messages. Users with older versions of the Google app (v12 and older) will be prompted to upgrade to ensure access to the latest version of Google Assistant.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-01-12T11:17:46+05:30"},

The highest offer during this round of recruitment was  ₹3 crore, up from  ₹2 crore in FY23.Post Phase 2, the projected overall placement rate across all IITs stands around 70 percent, reflecting a decline from the previous year’s 77 percent, according to Careernet’s analysis.Among the 17,800 enrolled students this year, 15,100 have signed up for placements, a slight decrease from the previous year’s 77 percent placement rate for a batch of 17,300 across IITs.Hiring Patterns and Campus SentimentsWhile there’s a visible slowdown in recruitment within IT services and consulting sectors, the data indicated an upturn in R&D and core sector hiring compared to the previous year.It added that despite approximately 40-45 percent of student placements in the initial phase, there looms a sense of apprehension among IITs regarding the forthcoming Round 2 placements.Further, insiders told the paper that \"strategic manoeuvring\" tactics, like advancing the appearance of companies originally scheduled for later slots to the first week, were undertaken to project a positive start to the placement season. It added that IITs have internally decided to not publicise the \"crore\" bracket offers keeping in mind prevailing anxiety.There is a projected dip of 10-15 percent in Phase 1 placements compared to typical years, said Anshuman Das, CEO of Careernet.Expectations AheadWith emphasis now on Phase 2 placements, IITs aim to achieve a 75-77 percent placement rate, it added. The top 8 IITs have a goal to cover around 30 percent more placements to reach their typical 90-95 percent target.Industry experts told the paper that there are concerns about lower-tier IITs facing challenges in attaining their standard 60-65 percent placement rate this year.", "Published_Date": "2023-12-12T11:14:59+05:30"},

Users can make ticket bookings for the metro service directly in Google Maps, through the ONDC framework. For Meta, ONDC is being integrated into WhatsApp, where small businesses will be able to streamline their onboarding process on the framework. The move will also form a key part of Meta’s focus on monetizing its India market in 2024, said India head Sandhya Devanathan in an interview on Tuesday.The e-commerce protocol is going through an adoption process across markets right now. Speaking with Mint, Thampy Koshy, managing director and chief executive of ONDC, said that the onboarding of new users is being scaled up at a rapid pace on the ONDC protocol. “In January, we announced public availability of ONDC in Bengaluru. At that time, we had just around 1,000-1,200 transactions per month. In just about 12 months’ time, the protocol is already seeing 5 million monthly transactions in Bengaluru,” Koshy said.The ONDC adoption on Google Maps, said Miriam Daniel, vice-president at Google Maps, will be scaled up in the coming months to become accessible for multiple public transport services.Koshy further said that large corporations such as Hindustan Unilever are also expressing an interest in adoption of the ONDC framework. Such adoption is likely to receive a boost from new regulations such as the Telecom Bill, tabled in Parliament on Monday.“My focus is on enabling digital commerce, and new progressive regulations will help in supporting India’s overall digital economy,” Koshy said.Availability of public mobility services on platforms has been increasing of late—Delhi Metro Rail Corp. on 5 October opened its ticketing service through WhatsApp for all lines.On 13 August, Koshy told Mint that the platform already had over 150,000 merchants on the platform, including 90,000 from the mobility sector. Over 50,000 restaurants were also a part of it.A key part of ONDC’s new partnerships would also be on skilling. For instance, Meta and ONDC’s partnership will include digital skilling of small businesses in order to help them migrate their businesses to digital platforms.This can further scale the onboarding of small businesses on digital platforms such as WhatsApp, Meta’s Devanathan said, stating that such a model would prove to be more fruitful than Meta joining ONDC as a seller platform for businesses to access the protocol through.", "Published_Date": "2023-12-19T23:53:25+05:30"},

It’s the worst decline in headcount at the ‘Big Four’ information technology (IT) services companies in at least five years, Mint’s analysis shows.This drop in hiring has come off the back of global macroeconomic uncertainties that have hammered India’s $245 billion IT services industry.The drop also comes two years after a record FY22, when pandemic-induced demand for digital transformation among industries saw India’s top four software exporters add over 300,000 employees.Industry experts and analysts say fresh graduates will struggle to find jobs at least until the end of this calendar year, while the immediate aftermath of this could lead to another cycle of rising attrition levels at IT firms.Infosys and Wipro have announced that they will skip campus recruitments at least until the end of this ongoing quarter.“This is the first time since FY19 that the companies are looking to skip campus recruitment,” said Prasadh M.S., head of workforce research and analytics at workplace statistics firm Xpheno.The current drop in headcount is in tandem with a decline in overall revenue and profitability of big IT companies. At the end of the December quarter, HCL Tech was the only company among the top four to have posted any meaningful growth, with dollar revenue and net profit rising 5.9% and 12.5% sequentially.“The Big Four and some of their peers are the only cohort that can spend on building talent for the overall industry. Simply put, onboarding 10,000 employees means adding at least  ₹400 crore as employee cost for a company—not many companies can do this,” said Prasadh. “As a result, when the Big Four do not go to campuses, the talent supply for India’s entire tech hiring demand gets constricted.”As a result, Prasadh said, any non-tech firm looking for tech talent will now need to look at lateral hires from other companies, which in turn will lead to higher costs incurred as the average cost of hiring will go up.Sunil Chemmankotil, chief executive officer (CEO) of staffing services firm Teamlease Digital, added that the influx of generative AI (artificial intelligence) has coincided with IT services firms experimenting with ways to improve their margins and efficiencies.“Typically, these IT firms were dependent on fresher hiring because a lot of entry-level hires would be first trained on basic tasks. The slowdown in fresher recruitments has also been a factor of the influx of AI and generative AI, which has led to a confusion in terms of how AI will intervene.”The key reason for the hiring slowdown was reflected in commentaries by the IT companies during their third-quarter results.Each of the Big Four CEOs said that the overall sentiment among clients across various industries remained cautious, and discretionary spending by clients was minimal.Debashis Chatterjee, CEO of IT services firm LTIMindtree Ltd, told Mint on 18 January that furloughs in tech spending had also affected even those sectors typically considered to be inflation-proof, such as oil and gas. TCS CEO K. Krithivasan told Mint on 14 January that there were no major changes to the overall demand environment.Discretionary deals are key growth contributors for the IT services industry. These deals typically allow software exporters to claim higher margins, and are indicators of a healthy demand environment where clients are not cautious or conservative spending on tech projects.Apurva Prasad, vice-president of institutional research at HDFC Securities, told Mint on 15 January that demand for tech projects among clients is unlikely to change at least until the second half of FY25.As the market revives, some industry experts say a second round of attrition surge could be in order. “As the market opens up, there will be a surge in demand for tech jobs. The industry is likely to see a second surge in attrition, which could yet again lead to a cycle of higher salaries,” Prasad said.", "Published_Date": "2024-01-31T24:09:33+05:30"},

The fresh reference will be sent in a few weeks. Trai’s fair transparent consultation process will be followed. It will give its recommendations on the mechanism of allotment, the frequencies and the pricing, among other things,” the official said, asking not to be named.“Trai has returned the previous reference in light of the new law and discussions with the industry have taken place,” the official added. The government enacted the Telecommunications Act 2023 in December where it added satellite-based communication services to the category of services that would be given spectrum without going through auctions.Talks on allocation methodologyTrai had first begun the consultation on allocation methodology for satellite spectrum in 2022 and had held several rounds of consultations including an open-house discussion last year but did not issue any recommendations. The regulator had sought views on whether auction should be the mechanism for allocation of airwaves for satellite-based communication services. With the new telecom law being enacted the consultation became infructuous.“The fresh consultations will also address the element of level playing field,” the official said, referring to the rift between industry participants on satcom services competing with services offered by terrestrial service providers or telcos.Some parties including L&T, Tata Group, Nasscom, besides Bharti Group, Starlink and Amazon, have backed the non-auction route, while others including Reliance and Vodafone Idea have opposed direct allocation.Also Read | 2024: A year of satellite broadband?Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Reliance’s Jio Satellite Communications are the only players that have got global mobile personal communication by satellite or GMPCS license. OneWeb is the only one to get the nod from space regulator IN-Space. Following the license and approvals, spectrum is needed for the companies to begin services in India.Elon Musk’s Starlink and Amazon’s Project Kuiper are also among applicants for the GMPCS license. The fresh consultation could render some changes to the license conditions, said people aware of the development.The government can give spectrum for several services including for satellite broadband through administrative allocation, as per the new telecom law. But, for most categories, primarily spectrum used for telecom services will be auctioned.Mint reported on Wednesday that the government had approached the Supreme Court before the Act was passed by Parliament informing the apex court that it was allocating certain airwaves outside of auction. By doing this the government was not seeking a change in the 2012 judgement of the apex court, the senior official said.“The matter in Supreme Court is basically a Misc Application for clarification on the above point considering the multiple litigations. It was filed in the Supreme Court following the due process before introducing the Telecom Bill in Parliament. The application doesn’t ask for changing the Supreme Court judgement,” the official said asking not to be named.On Monday, the government sought an urgent hearing from the bench led by Supreme Court chief justice D.Y. Chandrachud, after having filed the application with the court in December, that sought clarification from the court on whether the government can allocate airwaves administratively through a legal process in cases of sovereign functional requirements, in public interest or in cases where an auction is not possible due to technical or economic factors.“As enacted in the new telecom law, only a very limited and narrowly defined cases including spectrum for walkie-talkie for police organizations, radar for weather forecasting, radar and communication for ships, communication for space and satellite applications, communication and radar for Army, Air Force and Navy and public sector undertakings (PSUs) like BSNL will be given on administrative basis,\" the official added. These cases amount to a minuscule part of the total allocations.The plea for clarification comes years after the Supreme Court in 2012 said that competitive auctions will be the route for distribution of natural resources owned by the public. A Presidential reference by the Union government also followed the judgement.Also Read | Trai releases consultation paper on 5G enterprise tech adoption ;", "Published_Date": "2024-04-24T18:39:53+05:30"},

Overall tablet shipments fell 24.9% y-o-y to 4.01 million units. Laptops account for roughly 65% of all PC shipments in the country, making it the biggest driver of all PC sales.On 6 February, Mint had reported that laptop shipments were set to decline in 2023, driven by fewer government contracts, slow tech spending among enterprises, as well as weak consumer demand for new PCs.“Big enterprises are not buying much, because of which the commercial demand for laptops has fallen. This is because companies are reducing IT spending to cut costs due to macroeconomic concerns. Combined with this, the first half of the year saw low shipments since brands were consolidating leftover inventory of products. This led to a shipment decline in the first half of the year, which revived in the second half due to the festive period,” Bharath Shenoy, senior research analyst at IDC India, had told Mint at the time.On Tuesday, Shenoy said that market sentiments improved in the latter half of the year. “The decision on import regulations, improving market sentiment, and an aggressive push from vendors ensured a market recovery in the second half of 2023. Despite a minor decline last year, the market was way ahead of pre-covid-19 pandemic shipments, which underscores the stability in the consumer segment,” he said.Weakness in enterprise tech spending will likely persist for as long as the West-driven macroeconomic headwinds affect companies across India, which is likely to keep demand for PCs muted. Demand for tablets saw a marginal 1.9% y-o-y increase in the consumer segment. However, a steep fall in educational tablets (down 53.7%) and small-medium business (SMB) tablets (down 25.9%) led to the overall shipment decline for tablets.Going forward, the market demand, especially among enterprises, is expected to remain tepid at best. Navkendar Singh, associate vice-president of devices research at IDC India, said, “With elections coming up in 2Q24, the commercial segment will be slow as deals/projects, especially in the public sector, will be delayed. However, an increased focus on local assembly and the launch of AI-powered devices in the second half of the year can provide a boost going into 2025.\"", "Published_Date": "2024-02-21T24:05:50+05:30"},

Vi has filed for curative petition in the Supreme Court where it has asked for reconciling arithmetic error basis its self-assessment, as it found error in base AGR dues of  ₹6,000 crore out of a total  ₹14,000 crore, and reduction of interest, penalty and interest on penalty to take down AGR dues by  ₹24,000 crore.ICICI Securities pegged the benefit from reduction in the interest cost at  ₹33,000 crore. “Apart from this, company has also prayed to court for reduction in interest, penalty and interest on penalty for base agreed number.

Government support has been unequivocally evident in recent months, but continued dilution remains a material uncertainty,” Citi analysts said.Larger govt stakeVodafone Idea’s chief executive officer Akshaya Moondra said in the fourth quarter earnings call that it was looking at converting upcoming instalments into equity after the moratorium ends in September next year. Following the follow on public offer (FPO), the government’s holding has come down to 24% from about 32% after conversion of interest component on debt to equity, but it still remains the single largest shareholder in the telecom company.

We have been discussing across all telcos in India. Once they decide, they will tell us what they have in mind,” he said.“As a technology provider, our ambition is always to get more but I will never say that we want to get less from any customer.

The loss-making telecom services provider is also in talks with banks and financial institutions to raise another  ₹35,000 crore through debt.The telco has planned capex of  ₹50,000-55,000 crore for the next three years, which will be primarily aimed at improving 4G services across the country, and launching 5G services in its 17 priority circles.

The capacities have been on an increase as telcos rolled out 5G services throughout the country last year.Slow growth, but growth nonethelessCarriers Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, which aggressively rolled out their 5G networks, will go slow on their capex plans from this year on, which is set to spell a slowdown in revenue for telecom gear makers including Ericsson.However, Bansal said that the growth was likely to continue albeit the pace may be slower than 2023. “We’re seeing more subscribers coming in, more data being consumed, networks not being congested but used even more. So, it will continue to grow, maybe not the same level as we saw last year, but the growth will continue,” he said.The carriers that have invested heavily into offering 5G services across the country were now looking at monetisation but have noted that opportunities were absent, prominently by Airtel’s top executive Gopal Vittal in the telco’s earnings call last week.Also Read: Tech-leading India market critical for Ericsson: Borje EkholmEricsson on Wednesday launched its innovative software toolkit and showcased 5G advanced use cases offering Massive Mimo, advanced RAN slicing, time-critical communication and 5G core.

This initiative follows the launch of a cyber crime reporting portal by the Centre on 4 March to address the growing issue of scam calls nationwide.The DoT’s notification targets scam calls where overseas callers impersonate officials and institutions, citing fake digital arrests, FedEx scams, drug/narcotics courier issues, and threats of mobile number disconnections purportedly from DoT or the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).“It has been reported that fraudsters are making international spoofed calls displaying Indian mobile numbers to Indian citizens and committing cyber-crimes and financial frauds. These calls appear to be originating within India but are actually made by cyber-criminals from abroad by manipulating the calling line identity (CLI).

A report by IIT Kharagpur-affiliated Future Crimes Research Foundation (FCRF) in October last year noted that financial gain-driven cyber scams account for nearly 60% of all scams in India, and over 40% of all cyber crimes.“First-time internet users are the most susceptible to scams due to a lack of awareness, and general fear among users on how things work. For example, if a first-time online banking user is told that their account will be frozen if they do not share a one-time password immediately, they might be inclined to share it—even though they should not,\" said a senior cyber security official of a homegrown cyber security venture, requesting anonymity.Experts suggest that addressing these issues requires extensive awareness campaigns and protective measures, especially for early-stage internet users.Also Read | Mint Primer: How Trai’s mandatory call ID will impact Truecaller", "Published_Date": "2024-05-26T20:41:36+05:30"},

The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) contends that these changes would allow telecom companies to use spectrum resources more efficiently.“Despite making huge investments for 4G/5G rollout, telecom service providers in India are still among those with the lowest average revenue per user (Arpu) in the world. India’s spectrum costs as a proportion of annual recurring telecom revenues are much higher than key global markets such as China, Germany, the UK, Brazil, or even neighbouring Pakistan,” said the COAI, citing research firm CLSA. “In this context, we urge Trai (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) to revisit the spectrum pricing recommendation, in line with global norms.”The plea comes as the telecom department gears up for the next round of spectrum auctions starting 25 June, which will include 4G and 5G spectrum.Auctions were postponed twice due to the Lok Sabha election. The previous spectrum auction had fetched the government a record  ₹1.5 trillion.Read This: Spectrum auction prices are still too steepLooking ahead, COAI has also urged the government to strategically plan the allocation of 6 GHz resources for future 6G networks. “To achieve the mission of 6G through initiatives such as Bharat 6G Alliance and Bharat 6G Vision, the industry needs massive spectrum resources which can deliver the higher capacity required by 6G,” the association said.Telcos and OTTsCOAI’s director general, SP Kochhar, emphasized the need for regulatory action amid concerns that large traffic generators or over-the-top (OTT) players heavily utilize telecom networks without contributing to the costs.“The rapid surge in data over telecom networks has put tremendous pressure on telecom networks, leading to severe quality of service (QoS) issues and drastically impacting TSPs’ customer experience. We feel this is a clear case of exploitation as the massive investment and efforts of the TSPs are being siphoned off by these service providers,” Kochhar said.Kochhar explained that the issue is not with smaller players, startups, or MSMEs, whose traffic generation is minimal compared to large OTTs. These OTT services consume large amounts of data, and the revenue they generate from subscriptions and advertisements is repatriated to their parent countries.“This causes a huge loss, estimated to the tune of  ₹10,000 crore, to the government exchequer. This is expected to increase further in the coming years, especially with the emergence of newer AI (artificial intelligence) applications and technologies such as video optimization on OTT streaming platforms,” Kochhar added.Challenges and recommendationsCOAI highlighted the growing problem of telecom equipment theft, which has increased significantly over the past few months. ;“There are several legal and technical challenges that make it difficult for them to recover the stolen equipment or to fully recover the loss. The impact of this is huge as it leads to poor QoS to end customers and significant financial loss for the TSPs,” the association noted.Additionally, the association stressed the need to make 1200 MHz of the 6 GHz mid-band spectrum available for expanding 5G networks, as the earlier allocation of 800 MHz was insufficient. According to a recent GSMA report, India could save as much as $10 billion annually in 5G network deployment by using the 6 GHz spectrum, COAI said.COAI also pointed out the challenges associated with testing and certification of telecom manufacturing equipment, essential for ensuring the safety and security of 5G infrastructure. The association praised the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for telecom and networking products, worth  ₹12,195 crore, and its amendment to include a design-led manufacturing scheme with additional incentives of over $533.33 million.Also Read: From the ashes of defunct telcos, there’s space for a new operator to rise", "Published_Date": "2024-06-12T20:15:21+05:30"},

The department of telecommunications (DoT) will conduct the auction to sell radio frequencies across the 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, 2,100 MHz, 2,300 MHz, 2,500 MHz, 3,300 MHz and 26 GHz bands.Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have collectively submitted  ₹4,350 crore as earnest money deposit, according to DoT data. Reliance Jio, India’s largest telecom firm, has deposited  ₹3,000 crore, while Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea deposited  ₹1,050 crore and  ₹300 crore, respectively.The deposits mean that each telco can bid three to four times the amount. However, sector watchers say that Airtel and Vodafone Idea would be looking to renew airwaves in some circles, while Jio may add airwaves in the 800 MHz band. Jio is expected to spend about  ₹3,700 crore as it may increase its spectrum holding in certain circles in the band.Also read | Back in telecom ministry, Scindia to focus on twice-delayed spectrum auctionAirtel could spend a minimum of  ₹3,800 crore as it will have to renew 42 MHz of spectrum in the 1800 MHz and 900 MHz bands in six circles, Jefferies said in a note. It may also bid in certain circles to increase its holding in the 800 MHz/1800 MHz bands to 10-15 MHz, and in the 2300 MHz band to 40 MHz. This could lead to a maximum spend of  ₹12,300 crore.Besides renewal, Airtel will add at least 25,000 5G sites in the circles of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Kerala and West Bengal to improve rural coverage, for which it has adequate spectrum.Vodafone Idea, which recently raised  ₹18,000 crore from what was the country’s largest follow-on public offer, has decided against renewing some its spectrum in the circles of West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh West, where renewals for 12 MHz in the 1800 MHz and 900 MHz bands were due. Therefore, it would end up reducing its spend on renewals from  ₹1,500 crore to  ₹200 crore for just the 900 MHz band.The auction is expected to be limited in scale compared to the 2022 bids, which generated a record  ₹1.5 trillion from the sale of 72,097.85 MHz of radio frequencies. The reason for the high bids was that 5G auction was being put on sale for the first time.Overall, about 17% of the spectrum value is likely to be sold, which could be the lowest in any auction since 2014. No excess demand in any circle or band is expected to be sold, implying that spectrum may be sold near reserve prices.Read more | Jio, Airtel and Vi deposit  ₹4,350 crore for spectrum auctionThe DoT has not included any spectrum in the 600 MHz and 700 MHz bands in the upcoming auction. Spectrum reserve prices have been increased in 3,300 MHz and 26 GHz bands by 12% and 8.9%, respectively. Reserve prices of the 1,800MHz band have been increased largely in Uttar Pradesh East. Spectrum base prices have been raised by 11-14% in bands or circles that saw demand in the 2022 auctions.The auction, which was originally scheduled for 20 May, has been postponed twice to finally take place on 25 June.While Mint had reported earlier this year that the government is expecting to mop up about  ₹10,000 crore from the sale, various brokerage reports leading up to the sale on 25 June have said that the auctions may fetch the government anywhere between  ₹4,000 crore and  ₹16,600 crore.The spectrum bought in this auction will be valid till 20 years from the effective date of purchase; spectrum sharing, trading and leasing norms remain unchanged. Telcos are allowed to surrender spectrum after 10 years from the effective date of purchase. Telcos can make a part payment of at least two years’ instalment, or multiples of complete years from thereafter. The buyer will have the option to avail moratorium for the corresponding number of years of upfront payment. For instance, three years of upfront payments would entitle a company for three years of moratorium. The other option is to pay up in 20 yearly equal instalments with the first instalment due in 10 days of completion of auction.

Kuo also reiterated a rumour about the headset sporting “video see through” technology, which is a way for users to see the real world while seeing computer driven imagery, too. This could enhance the use cases for the headset, beyond general consumers, and make it useful for medical purposes, factory floors and more.Kuo called the headset a head-mounted display, or HMD, and said that a company called Genius is a major supplier for lenses for the Apple AR headset. Genius is also the company that supplies the camera lenses for Apple’s iPhones right now.

In addition, Cert is also asking VPN providers to keep a record of the IP and email addresses that the customer uses to register the service, along with the timestamp of registration. Most importantly, however, VPN providers will have to store all IP addresses issued to a customer and a list of IP addresses that its customers generally use.What does this mean for VPN providers?VPNs basically obscure a person’s internet usage by jumping the signal off multiple servers. A log of these servers can easily lead law enforcement agencies back to the original user. That is why most top VPN operators provide a “no logging” service—at least for paying users. This means they do not keep logs of the user’s usage history or the IP addresses of servers involved. Such services could be in violation of Cert’s rules by simply operating in India. That said, it is worth noting that ‘no logs’ does not mean zero logs. VPN services still need to maintain some logs to run their service efficiently.&nbsp;Does this mean VPNs will become useless?No. The Indian government has not banned VPNs yet, so they can still be used to access content that is blocked in an area, which is the most common usage of these services. However, journalists, activists, and others who use such services to hide their internet footprint will have to think twice about them.What kind of data do VPNs log?Some VPNs log data required to enforce device caps, measure how much data they have used, and monitor network performance. However, many services log browsing data, metadata about a person’s usage, websites they have visited, IP addresses involved, and more. Some, such as Hola VPN, also collect information on other apps installed on a person’s phone and when they register or sign-in to social media, according to the firm’s privacy policy. The name and email address of a user is available to virtually any VPN service.What does it mean for users?For law enforcement agencies, a move like this will make it easier to track criminals who use VPNs to hide their internet footprint. But experts have pointed out that governments and their agencies can easily misuse such a rule. They also pointed out that this may actually drive such users towards the dark and deep web, which are much tougher to police than VPN services. It is also unclear whether the Centre will use this to take action against users accessing content that is blocked in India using VPNs, such as the game PUBG Mobile.", "Published_Date": "2022-05-05T22:49:59+05:30"},

SKM (Non-Political) leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal said the Centre’s proposal of buying five crops at MSP will only be meant for those who go for crop diversification.’Shifting focus from legal framework to crop diversification’Farmers demanded a legal guarantee of MSP for all 23 crops and not just for pulses, maize, and cotton, as proposed by the government. According to Down to Earth, farmers and experts believe that the Centre’s proposal is a \"diversion of focus from a legal framework for MSP to a couple of crops and to the subject of crop diversification\".ALSO READ: Farmers protest: From mobile internet ban to traffic advisory for Delhi, Noida, Guargaon; Here are top 10 pointsMSP is currently provided on paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, tur (arhar), moong, urad, cotton, groundnut, sunflower seed, soyabean, sesamum, nigerseed, wheat, barley, gram, masur (lentil), rapeseed & mustard, safflower, toria, copra and de-husked coconut.While sharing the Centre’s proposal on Monday, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said during the fourth round of talks, farmers had pointed out that they want to diversify into maize crops but want to avoid suffering losses when the prices drop below the MSP.ALSO READ: Farmers set to resume protest; agri minister Munda urges peaceMeanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann reportedly said farmers of the state can adopt cotton and maize only if they get a guarantee for MSP on these crops. He even stressed that the assured marketing of these crops can encourage the farmers to opt for crop diversification.However, farmer leaders believed that only those who switch to other crops from paddy will receive MSP under the government’s new plan. \"It meant that MSP would be given to only those who switch over from paddy to pulses. It will not be given to those growing ’moong’ crops besides paddy,\" Dallewal was quoted by PTI saying. He asserted that farmers were demanding MSP on all 23 crops.ALSO READ: Farmers protest 2.0: From demands to leadership, ‘Delhi Chalo’ march is vastly different this time. 10 things to knowHow can MSP help in crop diversification?According to reports, crop diversification seems to be one of the benefits of legalising MSP for all the 23 crops. Guaranteeing MSP for all crops may encourage farmers to grow crops other than paddy and wheat, the Deccan Herald reported. It is widely said that farmers are inclined to opt for these two crops mainly because of the MSP support and risk for other crops.But MSP on all crops is not enough for crop diversification...Let’s first understand why farmers opt for paddy cultivationAgriculture experts say that paddy was not a crop of Punjab. Farmers didn’t grow paddy until they were asked to cultivate it to ensure food security. They were given prices to grow this crop. Now, the production of both wheat and paddy increased and food security is no longer an issue. However, it would now be difficult for farmers to suddenly switch to a new crop.ALSO READ: Delhi Chalo march: Govt invites farmer leaders for fifth round of discussion on MSPDevinder Sharma, an expert in agricultural policy, noted that many farmers in the past had chosen to grow alternative crops but they came back to paddy because the net return on other crops is less than the net return they get from paddy. He said the net returns on paddy will remain higher even if the government brings MSP on other crops.If the government wants crop diversification…The expert said if the government wants crop diversification, it should give good returns to farmers. In case the government seeks to promote millets and wants farmers to grow them, \"then they must give farmers the right package and then they might shift to the millets,\" Sharma said.He said reducing MSP on paddy and increasing that for other crops is not a solution. He added that farmers will shift to another crop only when they will be given economically viable alternatives.\"Paddy is a cash crop for farmers because 90 per cent is procured by the state...if you want them to shift then give them the right kind of price,\" he said.\"Today 14 per cent of farmers are given MSP,\" said the agriculture expert while citing the data shared in Parliament. \"This way, 86 per cent of farmers are given less price, they are dependent on markets. Those who are dependent on markets are given 25-30 per cent less price for their crops...farmers are being given the desired amount and that’s why they are protesting,\" Devinder Sharma said.He pointed out that the farmers are not demanding that the government should buy everything. \"They want to make sure that no one buys their crops for an amount below this (MSP) benchmark,\" he added.How crop diversification can help environment?1. Air pollutionThe burning of the remains of paddy crops or stubble burning is one of the major reasons for severe air pollution in Delhi NCR during the winter season. Environmentalists have often batted for crop diversification to reduce the farmers’ dependence on paddy cultivation.In January, Special Chief Secretary (Development) KAP Sinha said the Punjab government is mulling the launch of the crop residue management campaign in advance this year to more effectively contain farm fire incidents, besides encouraging growers to adopt crop diversification.2. Groundwater depletionVivek Chattopadhyay, the principal programme manager with Centre for Science Environment’s Clean Air team, had earlier told Mint that paddy is grown where ample water is required. He had said, \"Punjab and Haryana don’t have much water...But because of the MSP...farmers have shifted to paddy and they are using groundwater heavily.\"\"Therefore, the government must look at policies and crop diversifications,\" he said while emphasising the need to shift to \"low-water intensive crops\".Meanwhile, Minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday that the government’s proposal, if adopted, \"will save Punjab’s farming, improve the groundwater table, and save the land from getting barren which is already under stress.\"", "Published_Date": "2024-02-21T18:10:26+05:30"},

The move is aimed at reducing India’s fertiliser imports.The union government said it has facilitated a mutually agreed price of  ₹4,263 per metric tonne for the sale of PDM by sugar mills to fertiliser companies for the current year. PDM manufacturers can also claim a subsidy at  ₹345 per ton at current rates under Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme (NBS) of the department of fertilisers. Sugar mills and fertiliser companies will now discuss how they can enter into long-term sale and purchase agreements for PDM.PDM, a potassium-rich fertiliser, is a by-product of the sugar-based ethanol industry, derived from ash in molasses-based distilleries. India currently imports 100% of the potash it needs for fertilisers, in the form of muriate of potash (MOP).The government has been trying to make India self-sufficient in fertilisers. It aims to achieve self-sufficiency in urea by 2025 by increasing production from 30 million tonnes to 31-31.5 million tonnes and replacing demand for 2.5 million tonnes with alternatives such as nano urea and urea gold. The target could be achieved by setting up new plants with attractive incentives for manufacturers, union chemicals and fertilisers minister Mansukh Mandaviya told Mint in a recent interview.“Production of PDM domestically will reduce import dependency and will make India atmanirbhar (self-reliant) in the production of PDM. The goal is to produce 1 to 1.2 million tonnes of potash ash from ethanol distilleries and use it in the farming sector. At present about 500,000 tonnes of potash ash generated from ethanol distilleries is being sold domestically,” Chopra said.Distilleries produce a waste chemical called spent wash during ethanol production, which is burned to produce ash. This ash can be processed to produce PDM, which has 14.5% potash content and can be used by farmers as an alternative to MOP, which is 60% potash.Data from the department of chemicals and fertilisers showed that India’s fertiliser requirement ranges from 58 to 63 million tonnes a year, but it produces only about 43 to 46 million tonnes of fertilisers. The rest is imported.India, the second-highest consumer of fertilisers after China, is entirely dependent on imports for MOP, and also imports 4.3 to 4.7 million tonnes of phosphate rock, 9.1 to 9.8 million tonnes of urea, 5.3 to 5.4 million tonnes of di-ammonium phosphate, and 1.2 to 1.4 million tonnes of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilisers.The government spends a hefty amount on this. India’s fertiliser import bill was  ₹2.2 trillion in 2022-23. It also spends a huge chunk of the union budget on fertiliser subsidies. In 2022-23, the government spent about  ₹2.55 trillion, a record high, on fertiliser subsidies.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her budget speech earlier this month, said the government would reduce the allocation for fertiliser subsidies by 13% to  ₹1.64 trillion in FY25 from the revised budget estimate of  ₹1.89 trillion for FY24. The original allocation for fertiliser subsidies for FY24 was  ₹1.75 trillion.", "Published_Date": "2024-02-23T13:16:06+05:30"},

The rear camera module is circular- which is also placed at the top-centre unlike other tablets where it is placed on either side. The power button is placed on the left edge where one can also see speaker ports. On the bottom edge are three contact plates that attach to the pogo pins on the keyboard. Charging port (Type-C) and two other speaker ports are placed on the right.Volume rockerz are on the top edge along with a microphone for video calls. The tablet comes with a OnePlus Stylo digital pen that magnetically attaches itself to the top panel for pairing and charging.The tablet has a metal finish and is offered in single colour - Halo Green that looks premium.DisplayOnePlus Pad comes with a large, bright display that is ideal for watching movies, playing games and reading online. The tablet comes with a 11.61-inch screen with 2800 x 2000 pixels resolution and 144Hz refresh rate. The display is not OLED, but LCD. While it could be a bummer for some, impressive contrast and punchy colours ensure that the viewing experience is as good as OLED.Now, the aspect ratio of the OnePlus Pad is 7:5, which means that the tablet works well in both landscape as well as portrait orientations. Also, viewing angles are good too. The display can refresh up to 144Hz along with a touch sampling rate of 144Hz. The scrolling and navigation experience of the tablet is smooth and lag-free.OnePlus Pad comes with support for multiple HDR formats – HDR10, HDR10+, HLG, and Dolby Vision. With 500 nits of brightness, using the tablet outdoors is satisfactory, though a little more brightness will not hurt.PerformanceThe OnePlus Pad comes powered by MediaTek Dimensity 9000 processor coupled with 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and up to 256GB UFS 3.1 storage capacity. The tablet runs smoothly and can easily handle multitasking. We did not face any hiccups while switching between the apps running in the background. There were no heating issues that we faced on the tablet during the review period.For gaming, OnePlus Pad is equipped with Mali-G710 MC10 GPU graphics to ensure a smooth experience while playing games on it.

The device also offers multiple connectivity options, including USB-C, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi, ensuring seamless integration with other devices and peripherals.Having said that, what is amiss in OnePlus Pad is the absence of cellular connectivity. You can not use SIM with the device and have to rely on WiFi and what OnePlus called the Cellular Data Sharing to use internet connection.Battery Life and AudioThe OnePlus Pad boasts impressive battery life, allowing users to enjoy extended usage without worrying about frequent recharging. The tablet is backed by a 9.510mAh battery with support for 67watt SuperVOOC fast charging.

While the 8MP front-facing camera is adequate for video calls and casual selfies. The camera UI of the tablet is simple with different camera modes and features available right on the screen.AccessoriesAccessories for OnePlus Pad include the OnePlus Magnetic Keyboard and OnePlus Stylo digital pen. Buyers will have to buy each of the accessories separately.Talking about the OnePlus Magnetic Keyboard, it attaches to the tablet magnetically using pogo pins. It is an all-in-one folio case that has a soft, leather-like texture for better grip. It has a chiclet-style keyboard with good tactile response. Having said that, it may take a while to get used to the keyboard. The trackpad, on the other hand, is smaller but does support multi-touch gestures.The Stylo, on the other hand, magnetically attaches to the top of the tablet for pairing and charging. The digital pen is easy to use.ConclusionOverall, the OnePlus Pad presents itself as a compelling option in the tablet market. With its sleek design, powerful performance, and focus on productivity, it caters to both entertainment enthusiasts and professionals seeking a versatile device. While the camera performance could be enhanced and there is no LTE support, the tablet excels in most other areas, providing a smooth user experience and a range of features that make it a worthy competitor in its price range.", "Published_Date": "2023-05-23T12:16:15+05:30"},

This is in line with India’s goal of achieving self-sufficiency in urea production by 2025.India’s urea consumption in the 10 months to February 2024 stood at 31.7 mt, down from 35.7 mt in the same period of the previous fiscal year, the minister said. “We will reduce 2.5 million tonnes (mt) of conventional urea consumption this year and replace it with an alternative fertiliser like nano urea. In February and March of FY24, we are expecting urea consumption to be no more than 1 mt on average, which will translate to a total of 32.7 mt of urea consumed in FY24,” Mandaviya said. “This is because of our efforts to create awareness among farmers to use nano-urea.”“In the past two years, the use of conventional urea has been lower in 344 districts, and 74 districts have started using more nano urea,” he added.About 3.3 million tonnes of nano urea (worth about  ₹7 crore) produced by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative (IFFCO) were sold from August 2021 to February 2024, the minister said.Nano urea is a liquid form of the fertiliser for which IFFCO owns the patent. Though the cooperative claims that nano urea increases the availability of nitrogen to crops by 80% and reduces the loss of nutrients from fields, these claims have been disputed by several scientists.Three plants across the country produce conventional urea to meet domestic demand. With India’s urea consumption growing at 6-7% a year, the government aims to use a fourth plant for its production. With this plant – owned by Talcher Fertilizers Limited in Odisha – urea production capacity could be increased by 1.25 mt a year, the minister said. The three plants currently in use produce 28.4 mt of urea a year.Increasing the production of conventional urea and using nano urea could reduce India’s import bill by around  ₹15,000-20,000 crore, union fertiliser secretary Arun Singhal said in April 2023.Data from the department of chemicals and fertilisers showed that India’s fertiliser requirement ranges from 58 to 63 million tonnes a year, but the country produces only about 43 to 46 million tonnes and the rest is imported.India, the second-largest consumer of fertilisers after China, is entirely dependent on imports for muriate of potash (MOP), a granular fertiliser with 60% potash content. It also imports 4.3 to 4.7 million tonnes of phosphate rock, 9.1 to 9.8 million tonnes of urea, 5.3 to 5.4 million tonnes of di-ammonium phosphate, and 1.2 to 1.4 million tonnes of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilisers.The government spends a hefty amount on this. India’s fertiliser import bill was  ₹2.2 trillion in 2022-23. It also spends a huge chunk of the union budget on fertiliser subsidies. In 2022-23, the government spent about  ₹2.55 trillion, a record high, on fertiliser subsidies.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her budget speech last month, said the government would reduce the allocation for fertiliser subsidies by 13% to  ₹1.64 trillion in FY25 from the revised budget estimate of  ₹1.89 trillion for FY24. The original allocation for fertiliser subsidies for FY24 was  ₹1.75 trillion.", "Published_Date": "2024-03-01T18:55:20+05:30"},

Offered across different price categories, Amazon Echo speakers have become a household name. Latest in the lineup is the Amazon Echo Pop. Featuring a new semi-hemispherical design, it takes the minimum of your living room’s space. The price tag of  ₹4,999 is an attractive deal, which is likely to attract many first time buyers of Echo smart speakers.Amazon Echo Pop designAmazon Echo Pop is probably the smallest Echo speaker in the market right now. The semi-hemispherical design is light, ergonomic and compact. It has front firing speakers covered in the fabric mesh. Rest of the speaker’s body is plastic. There are three buttons at the top - two to adjust to control volume levels and the other one is a mute button. Then there is also an LED strip that lights up when interacting with the speaker.Amazon Echo Pop is offered in Charcoal, Glacier White, Lavender Bloom and Midnight Teal colour variants. The unit we received for review was the Charcoal that looked good.Overall, the design is new, but not an eye catcher. It is ideal for small rooms.Amazon Echo Pop setupThe startup process is simple like other Alexa devices. Download the Alexa app and login to your Amazon account. In the app, tap on Add devices and wait for it to search Amazon Echo Pop. Once you see the device in the list, tap on it to pair and after a few minutes, your Amazon Echo Pop is ready to use.Amazon Echo Pop performance and soundBefore delving into the performance part, let’s reinstate here that it comes with an affordable price tag. It is further advisable to not keep your expectations high in terms of audio quality. Amazon Echo Pop justifies its role as a smart speaker. It was quick to pick up commands. The device is functional in the sense that you can easily control your smart home devices like a smart bulb or a smart plug with Echo Pop.Putting its skills to test, we created routines for the Echo Pop to turn off lights at 10pm in the night and then turn them on in the morning at 8. The smart speaker performed the duty well, without any hiccups. Then we also set up a daily alarm for 7 in the morning. It fulfilled this with precision.Talking about playing music on Amazon Echo Pop, the device supports multiple music streaming apps from Jio Saavn to Hungama to Apple Music. The speaker works well at volume levels between 5 to 7. The audio begins to get distorted at volume levels beyond this.Where we found the device to be a not-so-success is the announcements. Amazon Echo Pop allows users to record messages in their own voice and play it in their original voice. However, the recorded messages played by it sound were weak and one has to listen carefully to fully understand the message. Similar issues we faced while answering calls with the Echo Pop. Our audio was clear and loud to the caller. But the caller had issues hearing our voice.Amazon Echo Pop comes with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi as connectivity options and both support 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. As with other Echo speakers, Amazon Echo Pop has language support for both English and Hindi.Amazon Echo Pop verdictAmazon Echo Pop is the latest offering by Amazon in its Echo range of smart speakers. It is also one of the most affordable devices in its category. At  ₹4,999, the smart speaker is a good choice for first time buyers. Along with enabling a smart home setup, it brings Alexa skills to your home while offering access to multiple music streaming platforms.", "Published_Date": "2023-07-13T11:36:00+05:30"},

The newly launched OnePlus 12R seems to be the torchbearer for this philosophy, since it now features last year's powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, while still starting at the same price of  ₹39,999 as the OnePlus 11R. The numerous upgrades brought to the OnePlus 12R have raised the question among various tech enthusiasts as to whether it is even worth spending an extra  ₹25,000 to buy the OnePlus 12. I will attempt to answer that very question based on 15 days of hands-on experience with both these devices.Also Read | OnePlus 12R review: Relatively affordable ‘flagship killer’ that ticks all the right boxesDesign and in-hand feelThe OnePlus 12 and 12R share a remarkably similar design, with the rounded camera module and curved edges on the back, while the fan-favourite alert slider has now been moved to the left, and an IR blaster is also present on the top of both devices. They also share a similar 120Hz LTPO AMOLED display to the front, with 4500 nits of peak brightness, 1600 nits of High Brightness Mode (HBM) and support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+. Speaking of similarities, both phones come with Gorilla Victus 2 protection on the front and Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the back.On paper, however, the OnePlus 12 has a slight advantage with a higher-resolution 6.82-inch display compared to the 6.78-inch display on the 12R. In everyday usage, however, both displays felt equally smooth and responsive, making for an immersive viewing experience. Both phones get improved IP protection this time around, with the OnePlus 12 boasting IP65 protection, while the OnePlus 12R comes with IP64 protection.In terms of in-hand feel, I prefer the OnePlus 12R, which is thinner and lighter than its older sibling, while also packing a larger 5,500mAh battery compared to the 5,400mAh setup on the OnePlus 12. However, the OnePlus 12R's smooth glass back means it's much more prone to fingerprints and smudges, which isn't an issue with the OnePlus 12's textured back.Software and storage&nbsp;Similar to other smartphones in this price range, both the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12R run the latest Android 14 operating system, but are based on the company's own OxygenOS, which is similar to stock Android in many ways, but also has some nifty customisations.OnePlus has promised four years of OS updates and five years of security patches for the OnePlus 12, and three years of OS updates and four years of security patches for the 12R.Meanwhile, the OnePlus 12 also has a considerable advantage in terms of storage and transfer speeds, coming with a faster USB 3.2 port and UFS 4.0 storage compared to the older USB 2.0 and UFS 3.1 storage on the 12R. The 12R is also limited to 256GB of storage, while its more expensive sibling comes with up to 512GB of storage.PerformanceOn paper, the OnePlus 12 is the clear favourite in the performance department, with last year's latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and faster Adreno 750 GPU, while the 12R comes with last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset and Adreno 740 GPU.But in terms of real-world use, both phones felt equally responsive and snappy across a range of tasks, including intensive gaming, streaming movies and switching between different apps. The OnePlus 12 may fare better in longer gaming sessions due to the latest GPU and faster memory speeds.CameraOne area where the OnePlus 12 clearly outshines its sibling is in terms of camera performance, thanks to the numerous upgrades OnePlus has implemented in its flagship this year.The OnePlus 12 boasts an impressive camera setup, including a 50MP Sony LYT-808 primary sensor, a 48MP Sony IMX581 ultra-wide-angle lens with a 114° field of view, and a 64MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. In contrast, the OnePlus 12R has the same 50MP Sony IMX890 sensor as last year, accompanied by an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens and a 2MP macro sensor.In my tests, I found the primary sensor on these two devices to be remarkably similar, delivering excellent detail and accurate colours in a variety of scenarios. Surprisingly, in some scenarios, the OnePlus 12R actually did a better job than the OnePlus 12 in terms of maintaining detail, while in others the OnePlus 12 simply outshone its sibling.The 8MP ultra-wide on the OnePlus 12R, while a capable sensor in its own right, is no match for the 48MP sensor on the OnePlus 12, which delivers much better detail and more accurate colours than its sibling. The lack of a telephoto lens on the OnePlus 12R further cements its older sibling's dominance in this segment.I really enjoyed using the OnePlus 12's 3x telephoto lens, which can take some great shots with excellent detail retention and minimal colour difference from the primary sensor. While the smartphone is capable of zooming up to 120x, I found photos with up to 10x zoom to be usable.As usual, readers can make up their minds by viewing the raw camera samples from these two phones via the attached Google Drive link.Should you pay  ₹25,000 extra for the OnePlus 12?&nbsp;Well, it's complicated. While both the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12R offer various improvements over their predecessors, including the addition of IP65 and IP64 ratings, upgraded chipset, bigger battery and improved camera performance, the OnePlus 12 is potentially less appealing due to the  ₹8,000 jump in its price from last year compared to its sibling, which starts at the same  ₹40,000 price point as its predecessor.Moreover, the OnePlus 12R also offers much of the functionality offered by the OnePlus 12 thanks to the addition of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, a triple camera setup, a fast 100W charger and Android 14-based OxygenOS. The 12R is also lighter and feels more compact in the hand compared to its older sibling, while packing a bigger battery.However, the OnePlus 12 may still be the better choice for users who want flagship cameras with Hasselblad branding, the latest top-of-the-line processor, faster storage and data transfer speeds, and slightly longer software support.Essentially, both phones offer great value for money, but if you're on a tight budget, you might want to save some money and go for the OnePlus 12R instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-02-19T22:54:21+05:30"},

This smartphone has fewer LED lights than before, but it is still generating a lot of interest in the Indian market. I have been using the Nothing Phone (2a) for over 20 days now, so let us dive into a detailed review. The company offers a smartphone with no unnecessary pre-installed apps. Let us see if this should be your next smartphone.PricingTo begin with the price,the smartphone comes at a price of Rs. 23,999 for the basic model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. If you opt for the 8GB RAM and 256GB storage variant, it will cost you Rs. 25,999, while the variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is priced at Rs. 27,999.PackagingMany people do not like the packaging of the Nothing Phone (2a) because it comes in a sleek box that is hard to open without tearing. Inside, you will find the phone, some paperwork, a USB Type-C to Type-C charging cable, and a SIM ejector tool. This smartphone does not come with charger which is a major miss.DesignThe Nothing Phone (2a) has a cool design that catches your eye. It is simple but looks good. The back of the phone is see-through and looks like it is made of glass panels. But it is plastic. This phone is easy to hold because it has smooth edges and a flat frame. The front of the phone has thin bezels, which makes it look fancy.Unlike the older Nothing phones, this one has only three LED lights on the back. Interestingly, the cameras on the back are placed in the middle of the phone, between the NFC coil. You can see some cables inside the phone through the transparent back.Speaking of ports and buttons, the power button is on the right side, and the volume buttons are on the left. They are easy to reach, even if you are holding the phone with one hand. At the bottom of the phone, there is a USB Type-C port, a speaker, a microphone, and a slot for the SIM card. On top, there is another microphone.Since the rear transparent panel is plastic, it is bound to get scratches and smudges. I would strongly recommend using a case for this smartphone.DisplayMoving on to the display, the Nothing Phone (2a) features a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with full-HD+ resolution. With a 30-120Hz refresh rate and up to 1,300 nits of peak brightness, the display delivers good visuals whether you are indoors or outdoors. Plus, with two color modes to choose from, you can customize your viewing experience to suit your preferences.The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5.It is worth noting that LTPO functionality is absent from this device. The stereo speakers deliver decent sound quality, enhancing the overall multimedia experience at an affordable price point.Software and processorRegarding software and performance, the Nothing Phone (2a) operates on Nothing OS 2.5, built upon Android 14. Offering a completely clean interface, it ensures smooth navigation through daily tasks. Additionally, Nothing is offering three years of Android OS updates and four years of security updates with the device.The Nothing Phone (2a) features a Dimensity 7200 Pro processor that is great for the day to day usage and can offer good battery life. It gets UFS 2.2 but I strongly feel that UFS 3.1 would be better. The benchmark results were satisfactory and the AnTuTu score of the Phone 2a was more than 6,80,000 points. This is a capable processor for daily use, and I did not face any major lag while using the smartphone. Even the gaming was smooth. While playing BGMI for more than 30 minutes, there was no frame drop on high to medium settings, neither I witnessed any heating issues.CameraThe Nothing Phone (2a) features a dual-camera arrangement, including a 50MP main rear camera and a 50MP ultra-wide sensor. It also comes with a 32MP front camera for selfies. Accessing various shooting modes such as Slo-mo, Time-lapse, Pano, Portrait, Night mode, Motion capture, and Expert mode is made simple through a quick swipe down on the viewfinder interface.During daylight shooting, the primary camera displayed satisfactory performance, although HDR showcased some issues initially, which the company fixed after its first update. In extremely bright settings, the 50MP sensor tended to slightly overexpose bright areas of the scene. However, the ultra-wide camera managed exposure better than it was expected.In low-light conditions, the primary camera performed well, offering more realistic images without excessive saturation. Speaking of selfies, the front camera works decently well in the complex to normal light conditions.As per the price point, the video condition is decent enough. The primary camera can shoot in 4K 30 fps or 1080p 60 fps.Features and SpecificationsThe Nothing Phone (2a) includes standard connectivity features such as 5G dual-mode, dual-band Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and GPS. It also offers a dual-SIM slot. Additionally, it comes with NTFS optimizations, a RAM booster supporting up to 8GB virtual RAM expansion, and a HyperEngine 5.0 designed to enhance gaming performance.One of the notable features of the Nothing Phone is its Glyph interface. With the Phone (2a), Nothing has refreshed the Glyph interface, reducing the number of LED strips to three while maintaining its white color. Yet, the Glyph interface remains versatile, offering 15 functions. These include a timer, Flip to Glyph for notifications, progress bars for apps like Swiggy, Ola, and more.This smartphone Nothing Phone (2a) comes with a smooth in-display fingerprint scanner. Nothing packs a 5,000mAh battery which lasts for more than 35 hours on a normal day to day usage. It supports 45W fast charging, since I used my 30W charger to charge the device, it was charged in almost 80 minutes from 0 to 100.VerdictThe Nothing Phone (2a) is a budget-friendly option from Nothing. What sets it apart is its cool design and software. It comes with neat software and a promise of three years of Android OS updates, along with a unique look. At this price, I think it offers a good overall experience, as it ticks most of the boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-04-03T11:05:43+05:30"},

Right from the design to the powerful MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate chipset, Infinix seems to have left no stone unturned to grab the attention of budget gaming enthusiasts. While Infinix seems to have everything covered on paper, does this translate into real-world performance and usability? Well, I've been testing the Infinix GT 20 Pro for over a week and here's my detailed review of how the phone performed in day-to-day use.Unboxing and design:The Infinix GT 20 Pro comes in a huge box with three different sections: one for the phone box, another for the gaming kit and the last for some paperwork. In the phone box, you get the Infinix GT 20 Pro, a USB Type A to Type C cable, a 45W adapter, a stylish back cover, a SIM ejector tool and a quality screen protector with some application tools.As for the gaming kit, we get a cooling fan, a mag case and a pair of fingerprint covers to improve gaming performance. However, the phone will not come with the Gaming Kit in the long run and Infinix is only offering these accessories for a 'limited period' as part of the launch offers.The first thing you notice about the GT 20 Pro is that the phone looks very different from other devices in its price range. The second-generation GT device comes with a 'Cyber Mecha' design that features a rectangular camera island and a C-shaped lighting ring on the back. The Mecha Loop lighting can be customised to provide different effects for incoming calls, notifications, charging, music and even gaming.At first glance, the Mecha Loop Lighting looks remarkably similar to the Glyph interface found on the Nothing phones. But Infinix has made its lighting ring more usable with the addition of RGB lights that can be transformed to provide four different lighting effects for different tasks.At first glance, the Mecha Loop Lighting, as Infinix calls it, looks remarkably similar to the Glyph interface found on the Nothing phones. But Infinix has made its lighting ring more usable with the addition of RGB lights that can be transformed to provide four different lighting effects for different tasks.The smartphone comes with a semi-transparent plastic back that looks stunning but is also prone to smudges and fingerprints.In terms of the in-hand feel of the Infinix GT 20 Pro, the phone comes in a boxy design, but the slight curvature of the edges means that it is comfortable to hold even during long gaming sessions.Display and software:The Infinix GT 20 Pro features a 6.78-inch Full HD+ LTPS AMOLED display with a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz (60Hz/120Hz/144Hz) and a peak brightness of 1300 nits. The phone supports 2304Hz PWM dimming, up to 360Hz touch sampling rate, WIDEVINE L1 and DCI P3 wide colour gamut.The screen is fast and responsive, delivering deep blacks, rich colours and excellent viewing angles. Coupled with the JBL-tuned dual stereo speakers, this phone delivers an immersive viewing experience and is ideal for binge-watching sessions. However, the sound output does leave something to be desired.The phone doesn't support HDR playback on Netflix, but oddly enough, I was able to play HDR videos on Netflix. I also encountered problems with the GT 20 Pro's brightness settings, with the phone automatically increasing or decreasing the brightness even though the automatic brightness mode was turned off. Hopefully this will be fixed in a future software update.On the software front, the GT 20 Pro runs on the XOS 14 based on Android 14, which comes without any bloatware or ads. The GT 20 Pro also sees a drastic reduction in pre-installed apps from Google and Infinix, most of which can either be uninstalled or disabled.Infinix has promised two years of OS updates and an additional year of security patches with this device, so the phone should be future-proofed at least until Android 16.Connectivity:The GT 20 Pro comes with an IP54 rating for dust and splash resistance, which means the phone can handle a few splashes and light rain, but not a full immersion in water. It also gets some key connectivity features such as NFC, an IR blaster for controlling your devices, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, FM and support for 14 5G bands.Infinix ships the GT 20 Pro with its own dialler app, which allows users to record their calls without getting the annoying 'this call is now being recorded' message.Battery:The Infinix GT Pro comes with a 5,000 mAh battery that can be fast-charged using the bundled 45W adapter. The phone took just over an hour to fully charge from 0 to 100. This is probably where Infinix falls behind the competition, as the similar-priced OnePlus Nord CE 4 comes with a 100W charger, while the Poco X6 Pro comes with a 67W charger.That minor annoyance aside, the GT 20 Pro comes with a lot of nifty charging features like the ability to select different charging modes according to the user's needs, an AI charging feature that learns from the user's routine to stop charging after 80 per cent, and the Bypass charging mode when turned on allows power to be sent directly to the phone's motherboard instead of the battery.The bypass charging feature, which has been borrowed from the Infinix Note 40 Pro, allows users to enjoy the gaming experience without worrying about the heating issues caused by connecting a charger.In my use of light gaming, browsing and the occasional streaming session, the phone lasted a full day without needing to be plugged in, with a screen on time of around 6 hours.Performance:The Infinix GT 20 Pro is powered by the new MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ulimate processor, paired with the Mali-G610 MC6 GPU. Infinix has also equipped the GT 20 Pro with a dedicated display chipset called Pixelworks X5 Turbo, which helps the phone deliver better graphics performance and improved resolution for images and videos.Considering its price, the GT 20 Pro performed remarkably well in all the major benchmarks. The phone achieved an overall score of 9,29,665 on Antutu. Following a similar trend, the GT 20 Pro had a single-core score of 1237 and a multi-core score of 3545 on Geekbench 6.&nbsp;In my real-world use, I had no problems with the GT 20 Pro, and the phone handled everything I threw at it with ease. The GT 20 Pro felt fast and snappy and there were no lagging or stuttering issues to report during the review period.The GT 20 Pro was able to load Call of Duty Mobile at very high graphics and max frame rate, while BGMI managed to run HDR graphics at extreme frame rates. The high refresh rate display combined with a powerful chipset, JBL audio, mecha loop lighting and a dedicated gaming mode all contribute to an immersive gaming experience on the GT 20 Pro.In my tests, the phone lost around 9 per cent of its battery life during 30 minutes of gameplay on the highest setting. Even during prolonged gaming sessions, the phone didn't get excessively hot or uncomfortable to hold, although the back of the GT 20 Pro did get a little warm after extended use.I also tested the new cooling fan, which did a good job of dissipating heat from the back of the GT 20 Pro, even in scorching weather conditions. However, during a 30-minute gaming session, the fan will consume around 30-35 per cent of the device's battery power, and it would be advisable to connect the device to a power bank instead.Camera:The GT 20 Pro comes with a triple camera setup including a 108MP primary sensor with OIS, a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro sensor to make up for the numbers.Given that the GT 20 Pro is a gaming phone, I didn't have high expectations for its cameras. However, the daylight performance of the 108MP sensor came as a surprise to me, with the phone managing to capture an excellent amount of detail and taking visually appealing pictures in general. The primary sensor also produces excellent portrait shots with natural skin tones and good edge detection. However, the phone does suffer from lens flare issues under bright sunlight and has a tendency to overexpose colours in some scenarios.In low light, the GT 20 Pro performed admirably, with images maintaining a high level of clarity without appearing oversaturated. However, I did notice the lens flare problem affecting some night shots as well. Comparing the GT 20 Pro to the OnePlus Nord CE 4, I also noticed that the latter tended to struggle with colour accuracy and the images had more noise than the OnePlus phone.&nbsp;The GT 20 Pro can record videos at 4K 60 fps from the rear camera, but the output remains shaky at the highest resolution and you would have to switch to 1080p 30 fps to get a more stable footage.The GT 20 Pro's 32MP selfie camera is nothing to brag about, but it does the job for the most part. However, I didn't like the fact that Infinix has enabled a brightness mode by default.In order to help readers make their own mind about the GT 20 Pro's camera performance, I've shared raw images taken in diverse lighting conditions via this Google Drive link.Verdict:Starting at  ₹24,999, the Infinix GT 20 Pro offers remarkable value for money, boasting the powerful MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate chipset, a vibrant 6.78-inch AMOLED display, and a competent 108MP OIS camera. While it may not claim the crown for the most powerful device under  ₹25,000 (that distinction remains with the Poco X6 Pro), it excels in offering an immersive gaming experience unrivalled in its price range. The phone also entices gaming enthusiasts with some unique features like bypass charging, RGB lighting on the back and a cooling fan solution for dissipating excess heat.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-25T08:24:13+05:30"},

What if I told you there's a new Windows laptop in town that aims to change all that? Well, that's where the new Asus Vivobook S16 OLED comes in, with its 16-inch OLED screen, larger trackpad and RGB-illuminated keyboard in a slim and lightweight form factor.I've been using the Vivobook S16 OLED as my daily driver for over 20 days, and here's my assessment of how the new Asus laptop has fared in everyday use.Also Read | Infinix GT 20 Pro review: A gaming phone that doesn't break the bankDesign:The Vivobook S16 OLED that I received comes in this metallic blue finish that Asus calls 'Misty Blue' (for those who prefer darker shades, there is also another colour option called Neutral Black).As soon as you remove the packaging, you'll notice that this is a very thin and light laptop, measuring just 13.9 mm in thickness and around 1.5 kg in weight. The large 16-inch form factor does mean that it might be a little difficult to fit into most commercial backpacks, but it will also come in handy for professionals who are constantly on the move and prefer a larger display.The new Vivobook also has plenty of connectivity options including 2 Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2 USB 3.2 ports, an HDMI port, a microSD card reader and a headphone jack.The S16 OLED comes with a full-size keyboard with single-zone RGB backlighting and a number pad. Following the trend of adding AI functionality to devices, Asus has added a dedicated copilot key to the keyboard (PS. I'm not a big fan of the copilot key and missed the right ctrl key, but that may vary from user to user). However, there is no dedicated fingerprint sensor on the laptop and users will have to make do with Windows' Face Unlock.Display:The Vivobook S16 OLED features a 16-inch 3.2K Lumina OLED display with 3200 x 2000 pixel resolution, 120Hz refresh rate and 16:10 aspect ratio. The display on the latest Vivobook has a 100 per cent DCI-P3 colour gamut and Pantone validation for professional-grade colour accuracy. Specifications aside, this is a pretty great screen with vibrant colours and exceptional clarity, making it ideal for watching movies and TV shows. The Vivobook's attention to detail should also come in handy for video editing tasks where the colour accuracy of the display is important.The immersive screen also makes everyday tasks such as surfing the web, writing in Microsoft Word or creating a PowerPoint presentation feel like a breeze. I used the laptop mainly for writing and the occasional binge-watching session, both of which were enhanced by the screen's high contrast, true-to-life colours and fluid motion.&nbsp;I tried using the laptop in a variety of lighting conditions and the 600 nits of peak brightness ensured that I had no problems with readability, even in direct sunlight. This is a 180-degree screen, supported by two hinges at the bottom. The hinge mechanism feels solid and the lid opens easily, even with one finger.To get the most out of this screen, you need to go into the MyASUS app and select the DCI-P3 colour option. Asus also allows users to adjust the display and volume settings to their liking. I particularly liked the Volume Booster option, which had a slight impact on clarity but allowed me to get a loud sound even in a rather noisy room.Functionality:Apart from the stunning display, the laptop also comes with RGB lighting on the keyboard, which definitely enhances the user experience. As with everything else on this laptop, Asus allows the user to change the lighting effect to their liking.Coming from a 14-inch machine, it took me a day or two to get used to the massive keyboard on this laptop. But once I did, it provided a very smooth and quiet typing experience. The Vivobook's larger trackpad is also quite fluid and handles all Windows gestures pretty well.Also Read | OnePlus Nord CE 4 review: Powerful mid-ranger with great battery lifeThe new Vivobook comes with a 1080p full HD webcam, which is good for attending meetings and making video calls. Asus has also improved the functionality of the webcam with a ton of AI features like auto framing, eye contact (helps you make eye contact even when you are looking elsewhere) and background blur.&nbsp;To be honest, I thought the Auto Framing feature was going to be another one of those gimmicky features that are heavily marketed but don't really translate well into real-world usage. However, it turned out to be quite useful in everyday situations, with the camera slowly shifting as the user moves to ensure they are always in the frame.Asus also ships the laptop with an AI noise-cancelling microphone feature, which can be customized according to the users' liking by navigating to the MyASUS application.Performance and battery:The variant of the Vivobook S16 OLED that I received has Intel's latest Core Ultra 7 chipset with 16GB of LPDDR5x RAM and 1TB of PCIe 4.0 SSD storage. The new Vivobook has integrated Intel Arc graphics and an Intel AI boost NPU. There are two other variants of this laptop, the Intel Ultra Core 5 and Intel Core 9 processors.When it comes to benchmarks, the laptop had an overall productivity score of 4755 on PCMark 10. On Geekbench 6, the S16 OLED achieved a single-core score of 1377 and a multi-core score of 9446. Meanwhile, the Asus laptop managed a graphics score of 3,637 and a CPU score of 8,647 on 3D Mark's Time Spy benchmark.&nbsp;In terms of day-to-day use, I had no problems using the laptop and it handled all my daily tasks with ease, including opening dozens of browser tabs and switching between different applications. Despite the scorching conditions outside, I was quite impressed with the heat management on this machine, as it managed to handle the thermals quite well during regular tasks.That being said, the laptop did get quite warm while running the PCMark 10 benchmark, but it managed to maintain the thermals during other benchmark tests.The new Vivobook comes with a 75Wh battery, which can be charged with the included 90W charger. Using the bundled charger, it took me 1.5 - 2 hours to charge the laptop from 0 to 100.While Asus claims a battery life of around 16 hours for this device, the Vivobook lasted around 9-10 hours on a single charge in my usage, which is still pretty decent for most users. Battery life may be shorter for users who are constantly streaming movies or playing games, but even then I would wager that the laptop can still deliver around 5-6 hours of backup.Price and verdict:The Vivobook S16 OLED starts at  ₹1,02,990 for the Intel Core Ultra 5 variant, while the Core Ultra 7 variant I used is priced at  ₹1,16,990. Meanwhile, the top-end variant with the Core Ultra 9 chipset sells for  ₹1,29,990.For this price, the laptop offers a stunning and large 16-inch OLED screen, a light and stylish design, an RGB keyboard, a large trackpad, loud stereo speakers and great battery life. It also comes with some nifty features such as autoframe, background blur and AI noise reduction.The lack of a dedicated fingerprint sensor is a big miss, in my opinion, as the Windows face reader isn't that intuitive to use, especially in poor lighting conditions. However, the latest Vivobook is still a very compelling package, especially for professionals who are constantly on the move and need a reliable yet lightweight laptop.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-05-28T23:29:49+05:30"},

All-India arrivals of wheat have fallen nearly 35% year-on-year to 8.6 million tonnes (mt). This is attributed to higher moisture content present in the crop, delaying harvesting, a senior official told Mint. ;As a result, wheat procurement by the government to date has been 36% lower than a year earlier. ;As far as paddy or rice is concerned, procurement remains lower than the previous season due to higher paddy prices, driving farmers to sell their produce to private traders, the official added.Paddy procurement during the 2023-24 kharif marketing season was 7% lower than the last season at 68.5 mt, while procurement of wheat till date in the 2024-25 rabi marketing season has been 7.1 mt against 11.1 mt during the corresponding period last year, according to the FCI and Central food grains procurement portal.“Moisture content in crops in these states is higher because of cool weather and cloudy conditions. The crop is in the field. It is not being harvested,” the official said, seeking anonymity amid ongoing general elections. ;“Low temperature and the overcast conditions are forcing wheat farmers to think that when the temperature increases the actual maturity of grain will be more than it is right now. This time of the year produce is very good, quantity-wise, and it will be better if they harvest a little later after a week when temperature rises so that maturing of wheat can yield good quantity. That is why the harvest is delayed by seven days in northern parts of India, specifically in Punjab, Haryana, western UP and adjoining areas of Rajasthan. Harvesting will be delayed by around a week in Punjab, Haryana and western UP.”“In the case of paddy, procurement is not higher. The main reason for getting less rice (or paddy) is because prices are hovering higher in the market than MSP (minimum support price),” the official said.As per the agriculture ministry’s Agmarketnet data, common non-basmati rice in key markets of Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar and West Bengal is selling for  ₹2,195-2,484 per quintal against the MSP of  ₹2,183 a quintal (for 2023-24 Kharif common variety).However, lower procurement of paddy or wheat is unlikely to create trouble for the government in terms of maintaining buffer stocks and intervening in the market if required, the official said. ;“We are quite confident of meeting our target wheat procurement of 30-31 mt. Earlier, the prices were higher. Now the prices are coming down with arrivals in the market. So, our procurement will increase.Overall, our rice procurement is around 7-8% or 5 mt lower on year, which is a good sign. If we get 10 mt this year, it will be better. In KMS, last year by this time, we got 73.5 mt of paddy. This year we got 68.2 mt of paddy till 3rd April. This means around 5.5 mt of paddy is less. However, 68.2 mt translates to 45.8 mt of rice, which is higher by 5.8 mt than our yearly requirement. If 5.5 mt paddy or 3.7 mt rice is less procured, it is good because storage is a concern at this point,” the official added.The FCI has 10.3 mt or wheat and 31.2 mt of rice available in its stock against the stocking or buffer norm of 7.46 mt and 13.5 mt, respectively as of 1 April.Queries sent to the FCI, and the food and public distribution department remained unanswered at press time.Also Read | FCI procures 100,000 tonnes of wheat", "Published_Date": "2024-04-21T17:07:33+05:30"},

As per a report in The Economic Times, India diluted its pesticide norms for herbs and spices by increasing the maximum level of a pesticide residue allowed by 10 times. In an order issued on 8 April, FSSAI raised the MRL for a pesticide in herbs and spices to 0.1mg/kg from 0.01mg/kg. The regulator cited “various representations” as the reason for this upward revision.Pesticides regulationThis assumes significance as the food safety authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore last month, banned four products of two popular Indian spice brands—Mahashian Di Hatti (MDH) and Everest, citing the presence of ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing agent which raises the risk of breast cancer and lymphoma, and the European Union’s food safety authorities flagged the presence of cancer-causing chemicals in 527 food products originating from India.Also Read | Do MDH, Everest masala cause cancer? ExplainedPesticides are regulated by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare through the Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee (CIB & RC) constituted under the Insecticide Act, 1968, FSSAI said in the statement. \"The CIB & RC regulate the manufacturing, import, transport, storage of pesticides and accordingly the pesticides are registered/banned/restricted by CIB & RC,” it said. The Scientific Panel on Pesticides Residues of FSSAI examines the data received through CIB & RC and recommends the MRLs after performing risk assessment considering the dietary consumption of the Indian population and health concerns in respect of all age groups.The total pesticides registered by CIB & RC in India are more than 295, of which 139 pesticides are registered for use in spices. The Codex Alimantarius Commission on Pesticide Residues, an international body, has adopted 243 pesticides, of which 75 are applicable for spices. The Codex panel has been set up to develop food standards under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme.The Codex Alimentarius is a collection of internationally recognized standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other recommendations published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations relating to food, food production, food labeling, and food safety.There are different maximum residue limits of pesticides allowed for many food commodities based on risk assessment data. For instance, the use of pesticide monocrotophos is allowed on many crops with different MRLs such as rice at 0.03mg/kg, citrus fruits at 0.2mg/kg, coffee beans at 0.1 mg/kg and cardamom 0.5mg/kg, chilli at 0.2mg/kg. The MRL of 0.01mg/kg was applicable in case of pesticides for which MRLs have not been fixed. This limit was increased to 0.1mg/kg only in cases of spices and is applicable only for those pesticides which are not registered in India by CIB & RC, FSSAI clarified.It further said that the limit was recommended by the Scientific Panel on Pesticide Residues which includes member from CIB & RC and project coordinator of Monitoring of Pesticide Residue at National Level (MPRNL), under the agriculture ministry, after considering the adoption of MRLs in the range 0.1 mg/kg and above by the Codex panel on spices during 2021-23 for spices used across the world. MRLs fixed by Codex for spices & culinary herbs range from 0.1 to 80mg/kg.Usage of pesticidesOne pesticide or insecticide is used in more than 10 crops with different MRLs. For example, flubendiamide is used in brinjal with an MRL of 0.1mg/kg whereas for Bengal gram the MRL is 1.0mg/kg, for cabbage 4mg/kg, for tomato 2mg/kg and for tea it is 50mg/kg. Similarly, monocrotophos is used for food grains with MRLs at 0.03mg/kg, for citrus fruits 0.2mg/kg, for dried chilli it is 2mg/kg and for cardamom at 0.5mg/kg.The MRLs fixed by Codex for myclobutanil used for chilli is 20mg/kg whereas limit set by FSSAI is 2mg/kg. For spiromesifen, used for chilli, Codex limit is 5mg/kg while FSSAI limit is 1mg/kg. Similarly, Codex standards for metalaxyl and metalaxyl-M used for black pepper is 2mg/kg whereas the limit set by FSSAI is 0.5mg/kg.“The new Codex MRLs for Dithiocarbamates, Phorate, Triazophos and Profenophos for Fennel is 0.1mg/kg. FSSAI aligns with the updated standards of MRLs set by Codex Alimentarius Commission and International Food Safety and Quality Standard setting body created by WHO and FAO of UN and the European Union,\" the FSSAI statement said. ;Also Read: FSSAI to probe allegations of high sugar in Nestlé’s baby foodThe MRLs are dynamic and regularly revised based on scientific data.

Inside the box, you will find a premium-quality case, documentation, a SIM ejector tool, a USB Type-C cable, a 120W SuperVOOC charger, and the phone itself. While many smartphone companies are reducing costs by excluding chargers, Realme continues to maintain its standard by including a charger, which is a commendable gesture.DesignThe design of this smartphone has received mixed reviews. If you like a shiny, glossy finish, you'll find it attractive. I have the “Fluid Silver” version, which showcases a striking dual-tone design on the back. The top part has a glossy, mirror-like finish that reflects light in captivating ways, giving the GT 6T a unique look with the Realme branding on the back, setting it apart from other phones in its class. However, this finish is prone to a lot of fingerprints and smudges.It boasts a curved display that exudes a premium feel. The subtle curvature along the edges enhances comfort and imparts a sleek, contemporary look.The sides of the phone feature a plastic frame with a matte texture. While it looks acceptable, the buttons are positioned on the right side, and although easily accessible, they feel somewhat soft. The top of the phone includes an IR blaster, a handy addition that lets you use the phone as a remote control for your TV or other devices. At the bottom, there is a USB-C port for charging, a speaker grille, and a dual SIM tray.DisplayThe Realme GT 6T boasts a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. This combination delivers a sharp, seamless, and vivid visual experience. The 1.5K resolution (2780 x 1264) offers notably greater clarity than typical 1080p screens, ensuring crisp text, detailed images, and enjoyable video playback. Whether you are surfing the internet, scrolling through social media, or indulging in your favourite shows, the display renders everything with exceptional clarity and vibrancy.Utilising an LTPO panel, the display intelligently adjusts its refresh rate, conserving battery during static activities while ramping up to 120Hz for smoother performance during gaming or scrolling through lengthy documents. This adaptive feature enhances responsiveness and fluidity.The AMOLED technology on the GT 6T delivers deep blacks, vibrant colours, and outstanding contrast, supporting 100 per cent of the DCI-P3 colour gamut for accurate, true-to-life visuals across photos, videos, and graphics. Realme asserts that the GT 6T achieves an impressive peak brightness of 6000 nits, ensuring comfortable visibility even in direct sunlight. With an IP65 rating, the phone is resistant to dust and water, while Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 provides advanced protection for the display, underscoring its durability against everyday hazards.PerformanceThis smartphone, the first in India to feature the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset, is capable of easily multitasking between a dozen apps, editing photos and videos, and playing heavy games.In day-to-day use, the GT 6T performs very well. Apps open quickly, scrolling is smooth, and there's no noticeable lag or stutter. The phone remains responsive with multiple apps running in the background. This is because of the 2GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage.The GT 6T excels as a gaming powerhouse, effortlessly tackling demanding titles like BGMI, Asphalt 8, and GTA Vice City: The Definitive Edition. It maintains consistently high frame rates without any noticeable throttling or overheating, even during marathon gaming sessions.Realme's \"Iceberg Vapor Cooling System\" plays a pivotal role here, featuring a substantial vapor chamber that efficiently disperses heat, ensuring the processor operates at ideal temperatures. This system is highly effective, enabling the GT 6T to sustain peak performance longer than many peers in its category.The GT 6T operates on Realme UI 5.0, built upon Android 14. It boasts minimal bloatware, but several pre-installed apps, including a few third-party ones that cannot be removed, remain. Additionally, ads in the search menu may be somewhat bothersome.Realme has committed to providing GT 6T users with three years of software updates and an additional year of security patches. Embracing the AI trend, Realme has hinted at upcoming AI-driven features for the GT 6T, although specific details have not yet been disclosed.CamerasThe GT 6T features a 50MP Sony LYT600 sensor as its primary camera, equipped with an f/1.88 aperture and optical image stabilisation (OIS). It complements this with an 8MP ultra-wide camera offering a generous 112-degree field of view. For selfies, there is a 32MP front camera.In daylight, the primary camera excels. It captures sharp photos with excellent detail and accurate colours. The wide aperture and OIS ensure bright, blur-free shots even in dimmer environments. The camera's HDR mode effectively balances highlights and shadows, preventing overexposed skies and underlit foregrounds that often affect inferior phone cameras.While having the option for a broader perspective is advantageous, the ultra-wide camera on the GT 6T requires improvement. Its 8MP resolution results in a noticeable loss of detail. Photos taken with the ultra-wide lens appear softer and less vibrant compared to those captured with the main camera. Moreover, there is noticeable distortion around the edges.The 32MP front camera on the GT 6T performs adequately for selfies. It captures detailed photos with generally accurate skin tones, although it tends to soften skin texture and brighten facial features slightly.Regarding video capabilities, the GT 6T supports shooting at up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. It delivers good video quality with adequate detail and stable footage, benefiting from its OIS.The GT 6T offers a variety of captivating modes and filters to explore. Noteworthy among these is the Sky Replacement mode, which automatically alters the sky's appearance in photos. Additionally, the Pro mode provides complete manual control over settings such as ISO, shutter speed, and white balance.Note: To maintain the original picture quality, images clicked during the testing are attached via the Google Drive link. (Click here to check these images).BatteryThe Realme GT 6T is equipped with a robust 5,500mAh battery that offers impressive longevity. Throughout our testing, the phone endured nearly a full day of intensive usage, encompassing extensive internet browsing, social media scrolling, Netflix binge-watching, and multiple sessions of BGMI gaming. The device features Realme's SuperDart Charge technology, capable of delivering up to 120W of power. According to the company, this enables the GT 6T to charge from zero to full in just 26 minutes. However, it is worth noting that the phone does not support wireless charging.VerdictIn the competitive price range of  ₹30,000 to  ₹35,000 for mid-range smartphones, the Realme GT 6T emerges as a formidable option. This performance-driven smartphone features a swift processor, a sleek profile, a premium feel in hand, and an impressive display. It excels in battery life and boasts fast-charging capabilities. The camera setup is also commendable. If you are in the market for a new phone around the  ₹30,000 mark, the Realme GT 6T is definitely worth considering.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-19T21:09:10+05:30"},

However, the revised estimate is 0.3% lower than the previous season’s nearly 330mt.Retaining its February estimate for wheat, the government said wheat production could be 112.9mt compared to last year’s 110.5mt and has pegged rice output at 136.7mt, slightly lower than the previous year’s 135.7mt.Wheat, the main rabi (winter) crop, has been harvested and over 26mt has already been procured by the Union government at the minimum support price.Also Read | Mint Explainer: Return of La Nina and its impact on Indian monsoon, agricultureThe estimate on tur production for the current season has been raised to 3.38mt from the February estimate of 3.33mt, but on par with the previous year’s output. It lowered the production estimates of chana (gram) to 11.57mt from 12.1mt and increased masur’s (lentil) to 1.75mt from 1.63mt. In 2022-23, the country produced 12.26mt of chana and 1.56mt of masur.As far as oilseeds are concerned, the country is estimated to produce 13mt of soybean compared to 14.9mt produced last year and rapeseed & mustard is estimated to be 13.1mt, higher than last year’s 12.6mt, the agriculture ministry said.Cash crop productionIn contrast, the government sees cash crops such as cotton and sugarcane production lower at 32.5 million bales (1 bale = 170 kg) against last year’s 33.6 million bales and at 442.5mt compared to 490.5mt in 2022-23, respectively. The agriculture ministry on Tuesday also released second estimates of production of horticulture crop for 2023-24. Horticulture production in the country in 2023-24 is estimated to be about 35.2mt, a fall from 2022-23’s 35.5mt. This is due to a drop in vegetable production, especially potatoes and onions.Also Read: Switch from rice, wheat, cane to get MSP on select crops: govt tells farmersThe production of Shree Anna, or millets, is estimated to be 17.4mt, a marginal increase from 2022-23 production.

Nearly six years on, and after launching several smartphones, Poco finally seems to have regained its lost touch with the Poco F6, which is currently making the buzz thanks to its flagship-level specifications.I've been using the Poco F6 for over a month now, and here's my detailed take on how the device has fared in real-world usage. So, without further ado, let's dive right in and find out whether the new Poco F6 is worth your hard-earned money.Poco F6 unboxing and design:Inside the Poco F6's black and yellow cardboard box, you will find the device itself, a Type A to Type C USB cable, a charging brick, some paperwork, a SIM ejector tool and a black plastic case. There is also a pre-applied plastic coating on the screen to protect the device from scratches.The Poco F6 is available in two colourways: Titanium and Black. I received the latter, and in terms of design, the phone is nothing to brag about. It comes with a plain polycarbonate back with a slightly shiny finish, which gives the device a minimalist look. The plastic back means that the Poco F6 is susceptible to fingerprints and smudges, but the black colour makes them harder to notice.There are two coin-shaped cutouts on the back for the primary and ultra-wide-angle cameras, followed by the flash and the Poco branding in the top right-hand corner. The circular camera layouts mean that the Poco F6 does tend to wobble when placed on a flat surface, but this problem becomes slightly manageable when using the bundled case.Also Read | Infinix GT 20 Pro Review: A gaming phone that doesn't break the bankOn the front is a flat AMOLED panel with a small circular cut-out that houses the selfie camera. The volume keys and power button are nicely stacked on the phone's right side, while the other side is completely empty.Weighing just 179g, the Poco F6 feels quite lightweight and comfortable to grip. I had no problems taking long phone calls or carrying the device in my pocket for long periods of time. Speaking of calls, the Poco F6 comes with the MIUI dialer pre-installed, so you won't hear the 'this call is now being recorded' when you turn on the recording option.The Poco F6 has an IP64 rating, which means it is fully protected from dust and can withstand light splashes or little rain, but not full immersion under water. In terms of connectivity, the phone has an IR blaster (no 3.5mm jack, unfortunately), a USB 2.0 port, support for 15 5G bands, Bluetooth version 5.4, Wi-Fi 6 and NFC.Display and software:The F6 boasts a vibrant 6.67-inch 1.5K AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 2400 nits (1200 nits global brightness). This is a sharp and punchy screen, and combined with the stereo speaker setup, it makes for a pleasant binge-watching experience. I also had no problems using the phone outdoors in harsh lighting conditions.On the software side, the Poco F6 runs on the new HyperOS based on Android 14. Xiaomi's new HyperOS feels lighter and has a number of nifty features but it also has its drawbacks. Apart from the pre-installed Xiaomi and Google apps, the F6 comes with at least 19 bloatware apps, including Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, Snapchat, Rummy Circle, Dream11 and Bubble Shooter. There are also ads all over the interface, including the start page (right next to the home page), the app drawer search and within the built-in Xiaomi apps like Music and File Manager.Also Read | Asus Vivobook S16 OLED review: Lightweight and powerful laptop for professionalsIn terms of new features, the Poco F6 comes with support for contactless gestures, allowing you to answer calls, switch tracks, adjust volume, and play and pause content using hand gestures. However, these gestures are only supported on Netflix and the Xiaomi Music app for now.What's really interesting are the new AI features that Poco has added to the standard camera app. There is a new AI eraser, which makes it easy to remove those unwanted people or objects. For example, after clicking on a picture, users can simply select the 'Remove people' option in the eraser and the phone will immediately recognise all the people in the picture and give you a one-tap option to remove them.There are also a few other useful AI features, including Bokeh (adjusting the amount of background blur after the picture is taken), Sky (adjusting and even changing the colour of the sky) and Stickers (adding different stickers to a picture). However, I noticed that these AI features don't work without an internet connection, which is odd since the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 does offer on-device AI capabilities.Poco has promised three years of OS updates and four years of security patches with the Poco F6, which means the phone should get updates until at least Android 17.Performance and battery:The combination of the latest Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, Xiaomi's new HyperOS, LPDDR5x RAM and UFS 4.0 means the Poco F6 can handle almost anything you throw at it with ease. The latest storage and RAM standards also result in blazing-fast transfer speeds and reduced app launch times.For years, MIUI users have suffered from Xiaomi's aggressive RAM management, which meant that apps and games would frequently reload even though they were in the apps tray. However, with the HyperOS implementation, Xiaomi/Poco seems to have taken care of this problem. Apps now stay in memory for longer periods without having to be reloaded for a while.Speaking of benchmarks, the Poco F6 scored 14,02,779 on Antutu. On Geekbench 6, it had a single-core score of 1,882 and a multi-core score of 1,882. While these scores are quite impressive and justify the Poco F6's 'flagship killer' moniker, I noticed that the phone got extremely hot while running the benchmarks and during charging.Strangely enough, Poco's Iceloop cooling technology seems to kick in during gaming sessions, as the Poco F6 managed to keep the thermals at bay during extended gaming sessions at maximum graphics settings.The Poco F6 comes with a 5,000mAh battery that supports 90W fast charging, which takes the phone from 0-100 in around 35-40 minutes. The battery life isn't the best in this segment, but it should still last most users a full day with medium usage, although power users may need to plug it in at least once.I do feel that Poco missed a trick here by not packing the F6 with a larger 5,500 mAh battery, which is becoming the norm in the  ₹30,000-40,000 price segment.Camera:The Poco F6 features a 50MP Sony IMX 882 primary sensor with 2x in-sensor zoom and up to 10x digital zoom. It also has an 8MP ultra-wide angle lens with a 119-degree field of view.Daylight shots are good, with images showing accurate colour recognition, excellent detail, sharpness and dynamic range. Even in low light, the Poco F6 largely holds its own, although I did notice that night shots tend to have slightly brighter colours and there is also a noticeable increase in noise levels.Thankfully, there isn't much of a colour shift when you switch to the 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, but there is a significant loss of detail compared to the primary sensor, which is understandable given the low megapixel count. The 20-megapixel selfie shooter is pretty decent for the price and takes some good-looking shots, with images that are closer to the natural skin tones.The primary sensor can shoot video at up to 4K 60fps, while stabilisation kicks in at 1080p 30fps. The ultra-wide-angle lens, however, is limited to 1080p 30fps and the selfie camera is capable of 1080p 60fps video.Overall, the Poco F6's cameras may not impress photography enthusiasts, but they should do the job for most average users. I have also included a Google Drive link with the RAW images from the Poco F6 to help the reader make up their own mind about the cameras on this devicePrice and Verdict:The Poco F6 starts at a price of  ₹29,999 for the 8GB RAM/256GB storage variant, but with bank discounts, you can probably get the phone for around  ₹27,000. So should you buy the F6 at that price? Well, its complicated. The Poco F6 is undoubtedly the most powerful handset in the  ₹30,000 price range. The addition of LPDDR5x RAM and UFS 4.0 storage also sets it apart from its peers, ensuring blazing-fast transfer speeds and a smooth user experience. However, the overheating issues when running benchmarks and charging the device make me a little sceptical about its long-term performance.If you can live with a few pre-installed apps and ads in the interface, HyperOS is one of the most feature-rich custom skins on the market right now. The new AI features within the camera app are particularly interesting and help in considerably streamlining the image editing process. Xiaomi seems to have toned down its aggressive RAM management strategy, and HyperOS now allows apps to run in the background for long periods of time.All in all, I think the Poco F6 is specifically designed for power users who want flagship-level performance without breaking the bank. While mediocre camera performance and a lack of IP68 protection mean it won't replace your flagship device just yet, the Poco F6 certainly sets the benchmark for performance-focused devices under  ₹30,000.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-20T22:53:12+05:30"},

In April, the government made stock disclosure of all pulses, including imported yellow peas, mandatory once a week for importers, millers, stockists, traders, and processors to prevent hoarding.Prices of pulses have been rising for over a year. In Maharashtra’s Solapur, tur prices have surged to  ₹11,100-12,250 per quintal, while chana prices in Delhi’s key markets have reached  ₹7,075-7,175 per quintal. These prices are significantly higher than their minimum support prices (MSPs) of  ₹7,000 and  ₹5,440 per quintal, respectively, according to spot traders.In the retail market, the all-India average price of tur dal was  ₹ 161.3 a kg, an increase of 25.6% year-on-year while chana was  ₹ 88.2 per kg, up nearly 18% on year, as per data available from the consumer affairs ministry on Friday.Though the headline inflation fell to 4.75% in May from 4.83% in April, the lowest in a year, food inflation, which accounts for nearly 40% of the overall consumer price basket, remained unchanged. It was 8.69% in May and 8.70% in April. By comparison, it was 3% a year ago. Inflation in pulses specifically moved up to 17.1% in May from 16.8% a month ago and 6.6% a year ago.Production of pulses, especially tur (kharif) and chana (rabi or winter), has fallen for two consecutive crop years (2022-23 and 2023-24) because of unseasonal rains in October 2022, deficit rainfall during the monsoon season and prolonged dry spells in major growing states throughout last year caused by El Nino.Curbing price riseThe union government has taken several measures to arrest soaring prices, including imposition of stock disclosure and stock limits last year and allowance of duty-free imports of yellow peas but to no avail.“We have proposed stock limits on tur and chana, and it could be in place till the end of September if approved by the concerned authorities,\" one of the officials cited above said. “The stockholding limit on wholesalers could be 200 tonnes for each pulse, 5 tonnes for retailers, 5 tonnes for each pulse at each retail outlet and 200 tonnes at depot for big chain retailer. For millers, the limit will be production of last three months or 25% of annual installed capacity, whichever is higher.”“Importers will not be allowed to hold imported stock more than 45 days from custom clearance,” the person added. “If they are found to have stocks more than the prescribed limits, they will have to dispose of the over and above quantity within three weeks from the notification issuance date.The government has been suspecting hoarding by pulses traders for some time, the official said. ;“The impact of yellow pea imports must be reflected in chana prices and tur prices to some extent but that has not been the case. The market and the price trend indicate supply tightness of chana, resulting in lower procurement by Nafed and higher purchase by private agencies. Either there is a problem with production, or people in the trade are manipulating the market,\" the official said.This is likely despite officials in April visiting mandis, mills and warehouses across producing states to crack down on hoarding, in line with the effort to raise supply and stabilize prices, the other official said.Production estimatesAccording to the government, tur production in the 2023-24 crop year is estimated to be at par with the previous season’s 3.3 million tonnes (mt) but the industry expects production to be 2.7-2.85 mt, falling short of the domestic consumption of around 4.2 mt. ;The government pegs chana production at 11.57 mt against last year’s 12.26 mt and domestic consumption of 10 mt. However, the trade estimates chana production lower from the government’s estimates at 8.5-8.7 mt.In 2021, the government had imposed stock limits on tur, urad (black matpe), masur (lentil) and chana and in 2023 on tur and urad.Queries sent to secretaries and spokespeople of the agriculture and consumer affairs ministries remained unanswered till press time.Also Read | Cabinet approves increase in MSP of 14 kharif crops for 2024-25 season", "Published_Date": "2024-06-22T11:48:54+05:30"},

Also, in a scheme of the SM REIT scheme which has opted not to undertake leverage, the investment manager shall always hold at least 5% of the total outstanding units during the first three years.

With a minimum size of  ₹50 crore and minimum holding of 5% of Investment Manager, this isn’t a significant entry barrier for newer Fund Managers however key checks and balances have been provided by SEBI,” Gupta said.Shrinivas Rao, CEO- Vestian expects the new guidelines to boost the participation of domestic and foreign retail investors, and liquidity in the Indian real estate market as an initial offering for an SM REIT is mandated to have a minimum subscription amount of INR 10 lakh per investor, contrasting with the earlier norm where fractional platforms often required an investment of about  ₹25 lakh.“SM REITs are now allowed to gather funds starting from  ₹50 crore by issuing units to a minimum of 200 investors instead of the earlier cap of  ₹500 crore.

Since 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has allocated  ₹43.53 trillion in Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) capital expenditure, an increase of 3.72 times compared to 2004-14.Opposition questionsCongress party leader and general secretary in-charge Communications Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday told a television channel that the ruling party was not discussing unemployment, inflation and development. The NDA government has been focused on scaled up expenditure on infrastructure in order to crowd in private investments and policy makers expect that with improved balance sheets of companies and banks, private sector investments will take off. Both the BJP and the Congress have focused on economy and manufacturing sectors in their manifesto, promising to make the country a production hub for the world. ;Sitharaman said that the upcoming Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will cut travel time between the two cities to 12 hours from 24 hours and the Zojila tunnel reduced travel time to just 15 minutes from 3.5 hours offering all-weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil, and Leh. The minister also said that ;Indian Railways has ushered in an era of modernization with modern stations, trains, facilities and technology. ;Also Read | ‘The national elections haven’t slowed down the Centre’s capex plan in Q1’", "Published_Date": "2024-05-15T20:46:42+05:30"},

The share of coastal cargo is expected to rise from 33% in FY24 to 42% by FY26, as per the report.Also Read: Impact of Red Sea crisis on trade will be seen in FY25, says think tank“This growth will primarily be driven by the coastal movement of coal along the eastern coast, complemented by added capacities and synergistic benefits,\" said Maulesh Desai, director, CareEdge Ratings. The government’s focus on building infrastructure for sectors like steel and cement and enhancing multimodal connectivity under the Maritime Amrit Kal 2047 vision, also supports the expected increase in coastal movements at ports.Coal throughput witnessed healthy growth from 292mt in FY22 to 367mt in FY23 representing growth of 26%. The growth in throughput was supported by increased power generation from thermal plants by 6% to 1059.9 billion units. Against this, the imported coal volume registered a year-on-year (y-o-y) growth of 18% to 249mt in FY23.However, the volume growth was also driven by increased coastal volumes of coal. Coastal volumes have risen from 80mt in FY22 to 118mt in FY23 registering 47% growth.During FY24, y-o-y growth in coal throughput was ~9% which mirrored the increase in thermal power generation by 9%. This supported the increase in domestic coal production and continued coastal coal volumes on a high base of FY23.Coastal throughput is expected to increase from 60mt in FY21 to 131mt in FY24 reflecting a healthy compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 30%, the report said. The same was largely driven by an increase in cargo movement on the eastern coast with the ramp-up of overall volumes at Paradip, Gangavaram, Krishnapatnam, Dhamra and Gopalpur ports. Contribution of coal cargo of the overall coastal volumes has increased from 22% in FY21 to 33% in FY24.Trade routes“The Red Sea crisis has led to an increase in voyage span by 15-20 days, in addition to higher freight rates,\" said Desai. However, the capacity liners’ readiness to expand container capacity—owing to healthy profitability by chartering additional vessels, cascading capacity from other regions, and accelerating fleet renewal—bodes well for balancing the increased transit times. The impact on cargo will primarily affect food grains and other perishable items, along with freight-sensitive or low-value cargo, which is estimated at 10-15% of container volumes. Going forward, a significant movement in charter rates that could impact cargo volumes and addition of by shipping lines will be a key monitorable.India relies on the Suez Canal route for its trade with European countries, North Africa, and the Americas, which collectively account for about 35% of India’s total foreign trade, primarily in the container segment. However, the impact on cargo will primarily affect food grains and other perishable items, along with freight-sensitive or low-value cargo, which together constitute 10-15% of the total volumes.India’s maritime sector is represented by the 12 major ports and more than 200 non-major ports along the 7,500 km of coastline. Overall, cargo throughput at Indian ports is at its all-time peak at 1,539mt for the financial year ended 31 March 31 2024 representing 7% growth over FY23. Cargo throughput for FY21-24 was also healthy with a CAGR of 7%.Resilient economic activity, increasing demand & consumption of major commodities, declining shipping freights and traffic recovery post covid were the prominent growth drivers, CareEdge Ratings said.Cargo at Indian ports is dominated by 3Cs. i.e. crude oil (termed as Petroleum Oil Lubricants (POL)), coal and containers. These three commodities represent 74-75% of total cargo throughput handled by ports. Over the past three years ended FY24, POL witnessed a moderate CAGR of 4% while coal and container volumes witnessed healthy CAGR of 13% and 9%, respectively.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-16T23:13:01+05:30"},

Irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing high-stakes Lok Sabha election, spending on infrastructure—which accounts for 25-30 per cent of steel demand—is expected to go up by 11 per cent year on year in the fiscal year 2024-2025. ;According to S&P Global, the outlook for steel demand in the country looks bright, irrespective of the outcome of the general elections in June. This estimate is based on the expansion plans initiated by major steel producers.Also Read: Vietnamese steel, shoes and other imports get stuck in India’s quality red tapeSources told S&P Global that steel demand is expected to remain at high levels for at least the next 10 years. \"We would expect the Indian government to continue its policy of supporting the domestic steel industry which is an important component of (the current) Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India programme,\" said Paul Bartholomew, Lead, Commodity Insights Metals Analytics.\"Even if the incumbent government doesn’t come back to power, there would be minor hiccups in policy for the near term, but steel markets seem to be comfortably placed for the mid-to-long long term going ahead,\" a Mumbai-based trader told S&P Global. India is expected to continue with its current export policy on iron ore despite secondary steelmakers’ demands for an export ban.S&P Global also found that irrespective of the outcome of ongoing elections in India, no major policy changes are expected as the country looks to maintain its economic priorities and keep the conversation moving on energy transition.This means India is expected to continue boosting spending on infrastructure, manufacturing, and construction in the coming years. All factors point to improved demand for steel, iron ore, coking coal, and scrap. India also aims to secure critical mineral resources like lithium in its broader clean energy plans.Iron and coking coal demandIndia’s iron ore shipments to China are at elevated levels, causing price volatility and putting pressure on the margins of secondary steelmakers, who typically do not have integrated operations. As iron ore exports rise, the secondary steelmakers seek a limited supply or pay higher prices for premium ore.‘’The usage of low-grade iron ore, which India typically exports, is not high in the country. The lower grade iron ore, particularly that which has sub-58 per cent iron content, is not useful for India,’’ said Anil Patro, India Country Head at Ashon International, a global commodities trading company.Also Read: Steelmakers to be given incentives to use domestic coking coalSecondary steel producers have been lobbying for an export duty on low-grade iron ore, but according to S&P Global Commodity Insights, this is unlikely to happen as major steel players are also exporting this material from their mines.As iron ore production is set to rise in the coming years, any incoming government would push for finalising the policy on beneficiation -- a process that boosts iron ore content through concentration -- of low-grade iron ores.The push for infrastructure means India’s coking coal demand is also expected to rise in the coming years. According to commerce ministry data, India’s coking coal demand has risen 10 per cent from 51.3 million tonnes (mt) in 2019 to 56.5 million mt in 2023, driven by robust infrastructure growth and related steel demand strength.Domestic mills have ongoing expansion projects, with India aiming to reach 300 million mt of steel production capacity under the National Steel Policy 2017. This will keep the demand for coking coal high as the country relies on imports of key raw materials, according to S&P Global.Livemint reported in 2023 that the steel ministry started industry consultations to frame India’s first stainless steel policy. The policy will aim to raise domestic capacity by nearly fivefold by 2047, from the current 6.6 million tonnes (mt) to 30 mt.India imported a record 12.11 million mt of ferrous scrap in 2023, up sharply from 8.37 million mt in 2022, according to commerce ministry data. The demand for imported scrap is expected to improve once the election results are announced on June 4 and buyers focus on pre-monsoon season restocking, according to market participants.Lithium demandIndia has also been making a push towards securing vital resources for its clean energy ambitions. This includes mineral lithium, which has been included under the critical minerals list of at least eight major global economies, including India. Lithium is used to build electric vehicles and energy storage systems, making it a key mineral in energy transition efforts.\"I suspect we will see further auctions of mining rights, and promotion of domestic processing development will move forward full steam ahead,\" said Cullen Hendrix, senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics.The current government is following what looks like an \"emerging playbook for large emerging markets: don’t leave money on the table in terms of downstream processing. Seek to ensure Indian lithium is processed in India for the benefit of India’s downstream green energy industries,\" said Hendrix.In 2023, India discovered about 5.9 million mt of lithium ore in Jammu and Kashmir. As most of those deposits are clay deposits, their processing is seen as more challenging than that of brine or hard rock deposits.Even as commercial solutions to extract lithium from clay deposits emerge in a few years, India will begin real mining. Until then, according to S&P Global, the country must explore partnerships to secure lithium supplies.India in January signed a lithium mining agreement with Argentina, the world’s leading holder of lithium-based resources, which is likely to play a crucial role in driving energy transition efforts and ensure a resilient and diversified supply chain for critical and strategic minerals essential for domestic industries.Even as the election outcome holds the key to how various policies will shape the next five years, according to S&P Global, India is likely to continue developing its critical mineral supply chain and fuelling its economy through capital spending. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-05-28T19:03:48+05:30"},

The projected increase from $96.1 billion in FY24 suggests higher expenditure on oil imports, assuming an average crude oil price of $85 a barrel, it said.This could hamper the economy by widening the current account deficit (CAD), potentially leading to higher inflation and fiscal deficits if not managed effectively. ICRA forecasts the current account deficit (CAD) will widen to $44-46 billion in FY25 (-1.2% of GDP) from $29-30 billion in FY24 (-0.8% of GDP). A $10-a-barrel increase in the average crude oil price for the fiscal year could push up net oil imports by $12-13 billion, enlarging the CAD by 0.3% of GDP, it said.The rating agency said any escalation in geopolitical tensions leading to a rise in crude oil prices could further hamper India’s economy as higher crude oil prices have adverse implications for the fiscal deficit, given that they increase the government’s subsidy burden, particularly for items such as kerosene and LPG. A rise in crude oil prices would also increase the retail prices of petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel (ATF), which would also effect GDP growth.Savings from Russian oilHowever, the ICRA report highlighted that the increase in discounts on purchases of Russian crude oil has led to substantial savings for India’s oil import bill. These savings soared to $7.9 billion in the first 11 months of FY24, up from $5.1 billion in FY23, clocking remarkable 54.9% growth.Changes in crude oil prices are expected to show up faster in the wholesale price index (WPI) than in the consumer price index (CPI) owing to the different weights in these indices. “For every 10% increase in crude oil prices, WPI inflation is projected to rise by 80-100 basis points, whereas CPI inflation is expected to increase by 20-30 basis points, provided that the transmission into retail selling prices of petrol and diesel occurs,\" the ICRA report said.During April-February of FY24, India’s overall oil import volumes stood at 278 million tonnes, a 1.5% increase from 274 million tonnes in the same period of FY23. This growth was primarily driven by higher import volumes for petroleum products, as crude oil volumes fell marginally by 1% to 210 million tonnes.Also read: India’s oil imports from Russia drops 19% in February, Saudi Arabia 2nd largest supplierAccording to an ICRA report based on data from the ministry of commerce and industry, the value of India’s oil imports fell by 15.2% year-on-year to $162.4 billion during April-February of FY24. This decrease could be attributed to a combination of factors, including a reduction in international crude oil prices and savings from the purchase of discounted Russian crude oil.After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Western countries cut Russian oil imports and imposed a limit on the amount of revenue Moscow could earn from selling oil elsewhere. However, India’s imports of crude petroleum from Russia rose sharply. ;In terms of volume, Russia’s share in India’s oil imports rose significantly from 2% in FY22 to 21.5% in FY23 and 36.1% in the first 11 months of FY24. In contrast, the share of crude petroleum imports from West Asia decreased from 34% in FY22 to 30.9% in FY23 and 23.3% in the first 11 months of FY24, the ICRA report said.

Thermax, a provider of energy and environment solutions, sees green hydrogen, produced by splitting water molecules in an electrolyzer using green energy, as a key investment segment, significant revenue from which will likely start flowing in after about three years, its managing director and chief executive Ashish Bhandari said.The company is exploring partnerships to manufacture and supply electrolyzers, and working on this space with a long-run horizon extending to 2030 and beyond, he told Mint. The Pune-based company is also actively pursuing partnerships in other sectors, including its industrial product segment.“The interest in electrolyzers for hydrogen continues to be very high at Thermax, and it is something that we are continuing to work on and are evaluating partnerships, doing some fair bit of our own R&D (research and development) as well. And these are all areas where we expect to make announcements in the coming quarters,” Bhandari said.India aims to produce of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030, as it seeks to gradually decarbonize its economy and cut the imports of fossil fuels.Bhandari explained that green hydrogen and chemicals will primarily be areas of significant investment, with revenue expected to commence towards the end of a two-to three-year horizon. Green hydrogen can power clean transportation, and is used to manufacture chemicals and fertilizers.The entire green hydrogen sector is still at a very nascent stage, and analysts are a little cautious about how and when this trend would unfold for the industry.Also read | Thermax share price rises 94% in a year: 2 key reasons why Jefferies expects more than 16% gains for the stockThe government has unveiled a production-linked incentives plan to bolster green hydrogen production and local electrolyzer manufacturing. Players such as Reliance New Energy, Torrent Power, JSW Energy, CESC, UPL, Welspun have won bids to set up green hydrogen manufacturing facilities in the country.Avendus Capital, a financial services firm, estimates the green hydrogen ecosystem in India will provide a cumulative investment opportunity of about $125 billion by 2030.“Given the 2030 ambitions of achieving around 5 MMTPA green hydrogen capacity coupled with approximately 10 MMTPA green ammonia capacity in India, we expect the installation of over 30 GW of electrolyzer in India alone,” said Prateek Jhawar, MD and head-infrastructure and real asset investment banking, Avendus Capital.Even though the current electrolyzer market globally is over-supplied, Jhawar believes that once green hydrogen plants start getting commissioned, there will be a significant rise in demand for electrolyzers. Higher manufacturing costs, though, have raised red flags. Jhawar expects electrolyzer costs to drop by over 50% from current international prices, along with an increase in efficiency by over 20% by 2030.In March, Thermax had partnered with Australia’s Fortescue Future Industries to explore green hydrogen projects – including new manufacturing facilities – in India. Both the companies were to explore opportunities to jointly develop fully-integrated green hydrogen projects for commercial and industrial customers in India.“So, the Fortescue partnership currently is on hold because we could not come to an agreement on some specific areas,” Bhandari said. Consequently, both parties have decided to pursue their own paths for the time being. However, there’s a possibility of re-engagement in the future, depending on the development of their respective technologies, he added.Bhandari highlighted that Thermax will remain active in its traditional areas such as chemicals, apart from green energy.Electrolyzers will fall under the green solutions business for Thermax. Out of the overall order book valued at  ₹10,111 crore, only  ₹791 crore worth of orders came from the green solutions business as of March 2024.In Q4, the green solutions business order inflow tanked 93% year-on-year, which Bhandari termed as \"just a temporary blip”. He said that one of the reasons for the decline was the slowdown in the biomass-based build-operate business, which was influenced by both falling coal prices and a general slowdown possibly related to the ongoing national elections. The second factor was some order cancellations and reclassification in its First Energy Private Ltd (FEPL) business, which negatively impacted the January-March quarter.“So as a net impact, we did not book as many orders as we would like,” he said.Even so, Bhandari pointed out that the pipeline remains promising, and he anticipates a robust rebound in the green solutions business during FY25.Meanwhile, analysts believe ordering in the green solutions business will fructify over the long term as the company scales up its investments.During Monday’s earnings call with analysts, the company’s management emphasized that alongside a large capital expenditure in the green solutions segment, Thermax sees its chemicals business growing in the coming time.Bhandari pointed out that the chemicals business is a long-term growth story. While it did not see growth in 2024, Bhandari said that Thermax aims to significantly expand its chemicals business in 2025.Over the past few years, Thermax has introduced several new products to meet the evolving energy transition requirements of its customers.

In April 2024, the PLF of gas-based power plants stood at 21.4%, against 14.2% in April last year. PLF is the measure of a power plant’s capacity utilisation. It is the percentage of energy sent out by the power plant in terms of installed capacity in that period.Gas-based power plants have usually not been significant players in the power sector.

Three sisters convene at their family home in a village that still bears the scars of the tsunami and earthquake that shook Japan in March last year. The eldest has suffered a meltdown, the second sister is a nervous wreck, and the youngest of the lot, who has taken care of the house for the past 15 years, isn’t exactly a pillar of stability. Whoever came up with the line “We are family” might want to do a rethink after watching this film, which is showing at Siri Fort Auditorium No 4 at 2.15pm.Kobayashi expertly navigate us through territory that is halfway between the Anton Chekov and Yasujiro Ozu. The bare-bones story comprises not more than a handful of bristling conversations between the sisters, including a lengthy sequence early on that goes on without a cut for over 30 minutes. Kobayashi displays none of the sentimentality that marked his previous movie Haru’s Journey. The sisters are openly resentful of each other – they call each other “asshole” at frequent intervals – and don’t hesitate to remind each other of their past misdemeanours. “I hate the Japanese,” says the clearly cuckoo eldest sister, whose hatred extends beyond her hapless sisters. Japan’s woes clearly extend far beyond natural disasters.Temperature controlAn effective counterpoint to the temperature-raising erotic fare that is the main serving at this year’s edition of Osian’s-Cinefan is the slow, unhurried observational cinema of Southeast Asia. Wichanon Somumjarn’s In April The Following Year, There Was A Fire is one of those films about nothing at all and the while universe itself. Somumjarn, a first-time filmmaker from Thailand, is clearly inspired by Taiwanese auteur Hou Hsiao Hsien and Thai wunderkind Apichatpong Weerasethakul (the lead character refers to the latter’s Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives in conversation). The wispy story is about Nhum, a slacker who contemplates the meaning of his existence between jobs. He quotes one of the conditions of happiness as articulated at Albert Camus at one point – to be free from all ambitions.The film’s own dramatic ambitions are as modest as Nuhm’s. Somumjarn ticks many boxes in the observational cinema category – he draws his characters from the working class, keeps the dialogue conversational and naturalistic and alludes to the larger social and economic problems that affect the country (in this case, the clash between pro-democracy activists and the Thai Army. Nothing of great significance happens, but that is the point of this kind of filmmaking – to find beauty, truth and value in the everyday. As a character says, “You can take anybody’s story and turn it into a film.” Not a bad antidote to watching sexually charged characters shed clothes and inhibitions at regular intervals. Showing at Siri Fort 4 at 10.30am.Ahmedabad, I Love YouIn April The Following Year, There Was A Fire ends with a popular local Thai festival that resembles Holi. Prashant Bhargava’s debut movie Patang is also centred on a celebration. Patang is set in the old quarter of Ahmedabad and follows a handful of characters who have assembled in the city to mark the annual kite-flying festival in January. A businessman in Delhi wants to sell his ancestral home and move his family to a newly developed suburb in Ahmedabad, but he faces resistance from his kin. Meanwhile, his daughter starts flirting with an employee at a local store.Patang compensates for its sparse storyline by investing heavily in atmospherics. The approach mostly pays off but also has its limitations. The restless handheld camerawork (by Harud cinematographer Shanker Raman) and Bhargava’s jagged editing make the place and its characters seem far more vibrant than they actually are. It’s hard to overlook the poor performances by some of the more inexperienced actors, or the implausibility of a short-term romance between a businessman’s daughter and a shop assistant. Yet, the kaleidoscopic imagery produces lovely little fragments of colour and texture. Seasoned actors like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Seema Biswas and Sugandha Garg stand out in the middle of the bustle with their finely tuned performances.

In a related development, Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOC) plans to sign a long-term LNG deal to buy one million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of clean fuel from Adnoc, said two people aware of the development.If concluded, this would be India’s first equity stake in an overseas LNG terminal, adding heft to energy-security efforts by the world’s third-largest energy consumer. The development comes amid a growing partnership between India and the UAE, an OPEC member. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited the country seven times in the past nine years and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has visited India four times. India has also signed a free-trade agreement with the UAE.“Conversations are on at the government-to-government level,” said one of the two people cited above.The LNG project at Al Ruwais Industrial City will have two 4.8-mmtpa LNG liquefaction trains with a total capacity of 9.6 mmtpa. This will double Adnoc’s LNG production capacity to around 15 mmtpa. Adnoc has already signed three LNG agreements from the project with Germany’s SEFE Marketing & Trading Singapore Pte Ltd, ;EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg AG (EnBW), and China’s ENN Natural Gas.Also read: Petronet LNG Q4 a letdown amid diversification, competition risksAn Adnoc spokesperson wrote in an emailed response to Mint’s queries, “We don’t comment on market speculation,” adding, “Adnoc’s lower-carbon Ruwais LNG project continues to progress toward the final investment decision, expected this year.”India imports around 55% of its gas requirement to meet the growing demand from its fertiliser, power, and city gas distribution sectors. According to the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), India’s LNG imports increased 17.5% year-on-year by volume in FY24 to 23.5 mmtpa.LNG deal aimed at bolstering imports“Indian Oil Corp will also sign a long-term LNG deal to buy 1 mmtpa from Adnoc,” said one of the people cited above. IOC had earlier signed an agreement with Adnoc for the supply of 1.2 mmtpa of LNG from 2026.The proposed deal is part of India’s efforts to fortify its imports of LNG. IOC previously signed a long-term contract with France’s TotalEnergies for 1 mmtpa of LNG for around 10 years, as Mint reported. Petronet LNG also extended its contract with QatarEnergy LNG in February by signing a long-term deal for 7.5 mmtpa of LNG.Also read: Indian Oil signs second long-term LNG deal with France’s TotalEnergies“This is about securing a toe-hold outside the country. It will help Indian state-run firms become world-class companies. Adnoc has been a good partner and has been offering India opportunities. The relationship between the two governments at the highest level has helped,” said one of the people cited above.With a growing presence in India’s energy security architecture, Adnoc is the only company to commit to India’s strategic crude oil reserve programme to date. In February 2018, an Indian consortium comprising ONGC Videsh, Indian Oil Corp and Bharat PetroResources Ltd was awarded a 10% participating interest in Abu Dhabi’s offshore Lower Zakum Concession – a first for India. ;Additionally, a consortium comprising Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and IOC was awarded the exploration rights for the Abu Dhabi Onshore Block 1. Adnoc was also interested in picking up a 25% stake in the ill-fated largest global refinery and petrochemicals complex proposed at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra, which hit the skids because of farmers’ protests.Queries emailed to spokespersons for India’s ministry of petroleum and natural gas and IOC did not elicit a response.Also read: India’s crude oil consumption up 4.6% in FY24, output rises marginally at 0.6%, imports steady: PPACIndia has been actively courting the UAE, which has the world’s sixth crude reserves and seventh-largest natural-gas reserves, and supplies 6% of India’s crude-oil imports. At three million barrels per day, Adnoc is the world’s 12th largest producer of crude oil.The push for long-term contracts has gained momentum since the gas market saw volatility in 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine war; as Russia’s Gazprom, the world’s largest explorer of natural gas, failed to honour the terms of a deal to supply LNG to GAIL (India) Ltd.

Recent global and local tax and regulatory changes have changed the perception that the tax function is merely compliance driven. The tax function of today is an integral part of discussions on corporate strategies and business plans.This is primarily on account of the pace at which tax administrations are creating precedents and embracing technology to widen the tax net, monitor compliance, and conduct targeted audits. The capability of the government to digitize tax compliance, monitoring and audits has reached a new high after the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). The compliance and reporting requirements under GST were designed to capture transaction-level details. The analytics on data captured by various tax and regulatory authorities has empowered the tax administration in India to focus its efforts towards potentially non-compliant taxpayers. Even at a global level, with the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) and specifically the three-tiered transfer pricing documentation requirements, a multinational company’s intercompany data will be available with several tax administrations where such organizations have a presence, and would increase the need for transfer pricing documentation to be consistent and speak the same language. Automatic exchange of information has enabled tax administrations to conduct joint audits, and organizations are anticipating focused lines of inquiry from tax jurisdictions, in view of the use of analytics for a risk-based selection of taxpayers for audits, and the need for better quality data to respond to such inquiries. This has resulted in a move towards centralization and automation of many internal transfer pricing processes around transfer pricing documentation to the implementation and monitoring of global transfer pricing policies around intra-group services, profit splits, and cash pooling.With governments gearing up with technology and analytics-driven tools to transform the manner in which tax is administered, taxpayers now have the additional burden of collation and submission of vast information to tax authorities, re-engineering and monitoring internal processes and workflows to align with new reporting requirements, and managing tax controversies. While traditionally taking a head count was an answer to increased tax compliance, now companies in India are compelled to harness the power of technology to effectively face these challenges.There are many examples of companies deploying technology for easing the compliance burden and reducing the risk of a tax controversy. A few examples are: (a) automation for extraction, validation, and submission of data to tax offices; (b) running analytics on data before submission to tax offices to identify potential risks; (c) automatic allocation and charges to associated enterprises; (d) automatic generation of periodic dashboards to evaluate the tax health of the organization; (e) advanced data analytics for year-on-year comparisons to identify trends with what-if analysis to detect potential red flags.However, organizations can no longer stop at just getting their compliance right and a more proactive approach is needed to prepare for what will come next. Keeping this in mind, tax heads and chief financial officers are taking stock centrally and rethinking the way indirect tax and transfer pricing was dealt with over the last 15 years. To bring in efficiency, accuracy and consistency, organizations are adopting different operating models for tax compliance and reporting. From complete outsourcing of the tax function to third parties to the setting up of in-house tax centres of excellence or leveraging existing centres to the adoption of a hybrid model, various approaches are being evaluated and implemented based on the ethos of the organization, with increased reliance on technology tools to manage the pace of disruption, achieve economies of scale and manage risks.Organizations are not shy about embarking upon the journey of mapping and re-engineering internal processes for effective implementation of indirect tax and transfer pricing policies, analysing the current and future state of readiness to respond to tax authorities, embracing customised technology solutions to ease the burden of compliance, and being an effective partner to business teams. For example, many corporations in the midst of finance transformation projects are making the tax function an equal partner in their journey, where previously tax was only a secondary consideration. Given the fact-driven nature of indirect tax and transfer pricing, companies are having to address the need for better quality data as the transactions take place, rather than at the time of an audit, and are enabling their enterprise resource planners (ERPs) to deliver on these requirements.As in every field, evolution and innovation will be constant and organizations would need to continuously look for opportunities for improvements and technology upgrades to stay ahead of the curve. Administrations such as China are already experimenting with blockchain invoicing and tax collection and, as they evolve, new applications may emerge for other disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in tax administration. In-house tax professionals and tax practitioners alike, who are updating their skills and learning new ways to operate, will clearly have the advantage.Bipin Sapra and Arati Amonkar are tax partners with EY.

While this was shameful to say the least, two good things also happened, according to various newspaper reports. One, the locals intervened to stop the daylight mayhem. Two, the Lucknow police have arrested one of the ruffians in the video and are on the lookout for another person.This attack on the people from Jammu &amp; Kashmir happened despite a clear message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 23. Modi said people needed to distinguish between the “0fight for Kashmir and fight against the Kashmiris”. The Prime Minister stepped in after hundreds of Kashmiri students faced physical, verbal, and even administrative harassment across India, particularly intense in Uttarakhand where educational institutes gave in to the protestors’ demand that no Kashmiri student be admitted to the next academic session.Modi’s note of caution in this case has, like his intervention after incidents of lynching and attack on Muslims and Dalits by cow-vigilantes, came a little too late. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister probably sensed that the legitimate nation-wide uproar over the Pulwama terror attack was effectively building a nationalistic narrative around the Kashmir problem and that these incidences of harassment of the Kashmiri people outside their state, would help develop a counter-narrative.To be sure, the Vishwa Hindu Dal is not affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or the BJP. But from the video, it certainly looks and conducts itself like one of those loony outfits that have mushroomed under the vast and vague umbrella of political Hindutva and which draw their strength, among other things, from the climate of rampant Muslim-bashing in which some members of the RSS and the Modi administration are active participants. It is this climate as well as the RSS-BJP’s long-standing discomfort with Muslims in India that could determine how the BJP addresses the Kashmir issue.For the RSS-BJP to be able to even understand the Kashmir problem in its entirety, it is essential that they identify the Kashmiri people, in the troubled state as well as elsewhere in the country, as a separate entity and do not look at the Kashmir problem from the simplistic Hindu-Muslim binary. This simplistic binary, evident in the generalized communal comments and innuendoes a host of RSS-BJP leaders keep making about Muslims, is itself a wrong template to apply to the Hindu-Muslim problem in India. But post-Pulwama and the Balakot air strikes, the general othering of the Muslim community that many in the RSS-BJP not only believe in but also practice could create serious obstacles for the BJP in understanding the Kashmir problem and orienting the political party towards a possible resolution of the impasse. This becomes important also because unlike the BJP of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-L.K. Advani era, the BJP of the Modi-Amit Shah era has significant and direct political stakes in Kashmir. It was part of the ruling coalition till recently and it still wields enormous political power and influence in the besieged state through the agency of the Governor’s office. Also, a BJP-led dispensation, and most likely Modi-led as well, has the best chance of returning to power in 2019 and as such the RSS-BJP would again be controlling the levers of power and patronage in Kashmir.On February 26, the Indian Air Force conducted air strikes on Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Taiyyaba terror camps inside Pakistan. The air strikes, while their impact in terms of the number of terrorists killed is being fiercely debated, clearly achieved key strategic, diplomatic, and security objectives that may have an enormous bearing on the Kashmir problem. As various commentators on security and international relations have pointed out, the air strikes have set a new normal in the India-Pakistan security equation. By going deep inside Pakistan, India has demonstrated for the first time that it won’t be deterred by the threat of a nuclear escalation with Pakistan if terror groups operating from the Pakistan soil challenged India. India also deftly deployed its diplomatic capital to isolate Pakistan at least in the post-Pulwama scenario and get a rare crystal-clear backing even from the United States to punish Pakistan. Finally, the Balakot air strikes are significant in terms of their possible impact on the Kashmir problem and may turn out to be the paradigm shift for any Indian government which is keen to make a progress on Kashmir.Immediately after the Pulwama attack, the Modi government, through the office of the Governor of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and the National Investigation Agency and the Income Tax Department, launched a big crackdown on the separatist leaders. The NIA and IT department conducted several raids on separatist leaders associated with the Hurriyat. The government has also banned the Jamat-e-Islami for suspected links with terror groups and come down heavily on its activists. Except for the PDP and the National Conference, no political party has spoken out against the ban.The crackdown on separatists, Hurriyat leaders, and the suspected cohorts of the terror groups could be a justified line of action in the post-Pulwama situation which prompted a political dispensation known for its hardline position on Kashmir to launch the air strikes. The impending elections also made a strong response to Pulwama a political necessity that Modi seems to have fulfilled by taking the political call to launch air strikes inside Pakistan. Led by Modi himself, the BJP and the larger Sangh ecosystem are exploiting the air strikes to build momentum for a presidential sort of parliamentary election in 2019. If Modi returns to power, the post-Pulwama situation has valuable lessons for the RSS-BJP that they must not ignore if they want to apply their minds and energies to the resolution of the Kashmir problem.The most significant lesson would be to note and understand the nation-wide response to the Pulwama terror attack itself. Pakistan-backed terrorism in Kashmir is not a new problem but the nation-wide uproar and the wide-spread and generous sentiment of solidarity with the security forces after Pulwama was clearly unprecedented. Rarely before has the entire nation stood so unitedly against a terror attack in Kashmir. Apart from the protests by political parties and organisations, even ordinary people across the epic swathe of this nation came out on the streets to mourn the dead and condemn terrorism. What the RSS-BJP need to notice is that Muslims across India, through some organised efforts or by way of extempore reaction, also joined the protest. The simple reason for this was that a majority of Muslims in other parts of India are not invested in the Kashmir problem from the communal point of view. The general climate of Muslim-bashing and attacks against the Kashmiris outside their state, however, threatens to communalise the Kashmir problem beyond its political and geographical epicenter. This is something the RSS-BJP need to guard against.While Pakistan’s efforts to internationalize the Kashmir problem have largely failed, the Pulwama attack did achieve an unintended objective. It truly nationalized terrorism in Kashmir and by extension the Kashmir problem itself. This is an important takeaway the RSS-BJP need to ponder.As commentators have observed, the air strikes have created a new normal. In the same way, the Pulwama attack and the air strikes have the potential to create new rules of engagement in Kashmir. As the crackdown on the separatists and a host of related actions suggest, the government wants to approach the Kashmir problem from a position of strength. While talks among all stakeholders including a chastened Hurriyat are still the only way out of the imbroglio, the diplomatic and strategic gains India has made since Pulwama position whichever political dispensation that takes shape in Delhi post-elections in a position of strength that must not be squandered away by the callous communal polarization and othering of the Kashmiris elsewhere in India.", "Published_Date": "2019-03-07T19:04:59+05:30"},

Anantha Nageswaran", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/v.-anantha-nageswaran", "Content": "The Credit Suisse annual Global Wealth Report 2019 is out. It contains more good news than bad for those who are concerned about inequality. The report notes that inequality between countries declined in the first few years of the new millennium. But, inequality within countries kept rising, even as the global economic boom that lasted until 2008 showered more benefits on the rich than on the bottom deciles and quintiles of the population. This trend appears to have continued until 2016. The good news in the report is that the undesirable trend—rising inequality within countries—appears to have peaked in 2016. It even ventures to predict that global inequality would edge down in the immediate future.For India, in particular, the report had some encouraging news. That is, the share of wealth of the top 1%, 5% and 10% has come down from the previous year’s levels. Especially, the top 1%, which had 51.5% of the country’s wealth, as per the 2018 report. The report for 2019 states that the share had dropped to 44.6%. That is good news. The total wealth in India appears to have increased from around $12 trillion last year to $12.6 trillion. However, the jump reported in gross wealth per adult by more than 100% (from $7,867 to $15,915) defies explanation.While some of these findings are encouraging at the margin, they do not constitute a trend. Much work remains to be done. A screenshot received from a friend on the share of profits, inputs and labour that goes into the production of an iPhone highlights the enormity of the imbalance that has built up between labour and capital. An iPhone’s value is apportioned as follows: 5% labour, 22% inputs and 72% profit. In response to such imbalances, candidates of the Democratic Party for the US presidential elections next year have proposed a wealth tax, estate tax and higher income tax rates for high income earners. Some of these proposals are reasonable, but some may bear bad consequences for economic growth and employment.There is a belief that a rise in inequality is one of the important reasons for slowing economic growth in advanced nations. For example, the number of billionaires exploded in the US in the 1990s and the 2000s from around 100 to over 600. During this period, the annual growth in per capita income dropped to 1.1%, compared to an annual growth rate of 2.2% between 1950 and 1990.Well, correlation is not causation; and, second, while the explosion in the ranks of billionaires might not have helped, shrinking their ranks might hurt growth. In short, the asymmetric effects of taxation proposals have to be kept in mind. Lowering tax rates for high income earners may not result in higher employment and economic growth, but raising them too much might prove to be negative for both. That might be especially so in an environment of low growth.In this regard, the quiet work on taxes done by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) offers hope. In fact, this could be one of the most far-reaching tax reforms to be proposed in recent years. OECD proposals would minimize the scope for tax arbitrage that multinational corporations routinely engage in. They do not pay taxes in the countries where most of their business activity takes place.The path-breaking elements of the OECD proposal are: One, it breaks the principle that countries only have a right to tax activities from companies that have a physical presence on their soil. Two, countries will have the right to tax a proportion of global profits of highly profitable companies no matter where these profits are shifted (“OECD takes aim at tech giants with plan to shake up global tax”, Financial Times, 9 October).Without checking the erosion of the tax base of nations due to profit shifting by multinational corporations, any redistribution of a surplus between labour and capital would remain a non-starter. However, it is chastening to note that the OECD has been at it at least for six years, if one goes just by the first-page hits while searching the internet for the “OECD Tax Proposal”. Hence, implementation would not be easy and it might be rendered toothless by legal challenges. One hopes that this pessimism proves unfounded.An article that appeared in Finance &amp; Development, a publication of the International Monetary Fund, in September 2019 showed that tax havens that attract money from those seeking to avoid paying taxes at higher rates in their host countries end up suffering from the curse of “too much finance”. Their tax-haven status attracts capital flows, leads to misallocation of capital and attracts talent to high-paying but largely economically unproductive jobs that are geared to help individuals and corporations avoid taxes. The financial sector becomes too big. Thus, the tax havens suffer too. So, there is some karmic or poetic justice, after all.The tax proposals of OECD, if they become a reality, will help us reverse the four-decade long skew in favour of capital over labour and also chip away at the problem of “too much finance”. That would be the best news of 2019.These are the author’s personal views.V.

Meghen sway Naga peace talks? | Mint", "Author": "Sudeep Chakravarti", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/sudeep-chakravarti", "Content": "The ominous stillness in Kashmir and ominous celebrations over Ayodhya buried a development seemingly distant from the mental constructs of New Delhi: the release and whisking away of a top rebel leader from Manipur. It’s an event that has a bearing on the dynamic not just in Manipur, but the Naga peace process.R.K. Meghen, or Rajkumar Meghen, chairman of United National Liberation Front (UNLF) was released from Guwahati Central jail on 9 November. Meghen served out a 10-year sentence with some remission. He was convicted in 2016 for waging war against the state, among other charges, but his incarceration since 2010 counted as time served. He had planned to head to Imphal for what was to be a hero’s welcome at a public function.But after a day, the rebel leader also known among the Meitei of Manipur as Sana Yaima—precious son— was taken back into protective custody by central government agencies, and flown to Delhi. There he remains under close government watch-and-wear-down, much like the peace process his politely-worded but emphatic detour is supposed to aid.If this seems complicated, that’s because it is. Primarily, though, it’s about who Meghen is and what he represents, and the power he can wield to tip the balance in the Naga peace process—and peace in Manipur.The non-tribal Meitei community to which Meghen belongs is about 60% of the population, and lives mainly in Imphal valley, about a tenth of the territory of Manipur. The valley is surrounded by hills, a ninth of Manipur, where mainly Naga, Kuki and Zomi tribes live. Outside Nagaland, Manipur has the largest Naga homelands. The ongoing Naga peace process seeks to offer a more autonomous administrative set-up for the Naga homelands in Manipur—and Naga homelands in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam—and greater political representation. This has raised concerns in these three states, particularly Manipur, about possible ceding of territory to Nagas—which the government has strenuously denied.This is crucial. In 2001, extension of ceasefire between the government of India and National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), or NSCN (I-M), the largest Naga rebel group—and the principal faction in the ongoing peace talks—beyond Nagaland led to an eruption of emotion and violence in Imphal valley. Protesters were killed. Government buildings were torched. The National Democratic Alliance government of the time quickly limited the ceasefire to Nagaland, the bizarre, realpolitik situation that exists to this day. It won’t need a Meghen to light a fire this time—Meitei angst and sense of tradition and territoriality are enough tinder. Other non-Naga ethnicities are similarly concerned, mainly on account of the heft that Naga rebel groups still carry, and on account of inter-ethnic blood-letting, in which I-M played a leading role, in the 1990s. It’s all tense, all delicately poised.As a leading face of UNLF, which has sought to protect Meitei and Manipur’s identity and project its autonomy since the early 1960s, when it was founded, Meghen carries clout in any incarnation. Moreover, UNLF is part of a collective of rebel groups called the Coordination Committee, or CorCom, that took wing in 2012, along with the Revolutionary People’s Front and its military arm, the People’s Liberation Army; Kangleipak Communist Party; Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup; People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK); and a faction, PREPAK-Progressive. A seventh group was later ejected.CorCom has participated in several attacks against India’s army and paramilitaries—and celebrated these attacks—on its own and in conjunction with I-M’s arch-rival, the Khaplang faction of NSCN which has for several years provided shelter and logistics support to elements of CorCom in Myanmar. Besides fighting Indian agencies, CorCom has also fought I-M. Indeed, in September 2017, I-M killed five members of two groups allied to CorCom. It will require much restraint and foresight to overcome such fault lines.My take is that Meghen, a graduate student of international relations from Kolkata’s Jadavpur University, will again have received an outreach that he has received earlier: eschew the path of rebellion and be a reconciliatory force to bring UNLF and colleagues in other rebel groups which are part of CorCom, to the table of peace talks. Added to this will be his heft as an influencer, as it were, in the Naga outcome.

From big fast-moving consumer goods firms to young startups, everyone’s lining up ayurveda-based nutrition and wellness foods, riding on a spike in demand for traditional brews and blends in a world suffering its worst health crisis.On the one hand, Dabur Ltd, already known for its ayurvedic and herbal products, is witnessing a huge surge in demand for its flagship immunity booster Dabur Chyawanprash and Dabur Honey. On the other, startups are looking to scale up their businesses to take advantage of the growing clamour for ayurvedic preventive healthcare products. Dabur has already launched a slew of immunity boosters such as Tulsi Drops, Giloy-Neem-Tulsi juice and an immunity kit. More innovations are in the pipeline in view of the shift in consumer preference.But it is really startups that are most upbeat about the opportunity, as they quickly fill in the need gaps. Ameve Sharma, co-founder, Kapiva Ayurveda, and scion of the Baidyanath group, which specializes in ayurvedic medicines, admits that covid-19 has accelerated consumer awareness and consumer demand. But Kapiva, he said, was growing even before the pandemic.For a company that started out as a retail model to create a chain of ayurveda clinics, Sharma quickly pivoted to being what he calls a “pure-play FMCG business”. “We expect to touch  ₹100 crore turnover next year,” he said, adding that there has been a rise in demand for his products in the past four months. Kapiva offers a range of herbal juices, powders and candies, gourmet honey and nutritional shakes. On the cards is a multigrain Kapiva breakfast, details of which Sharma is reluctant to share.“Ayurveda is more preventive than curative. It is a lifestyle solution. We wanted to offer a modern take on ayurveda that resonates with the consumers,” Sharma said.Initially thought to be a metro-centric brand with its slightly premium pricing, online demand for Kapiva now comes from tier-2 and tier-3 cities. “In the last five years, customers have become proactive about health. They worry even about things like quality of sleep. With longer working hours, increased pollution and decline in the quality of food, they need to build immunity,” Sharma said.V.S. Kannan Sitaram, venture partner, Fireside Ventures, which has invested in Kapiva, said there’s a definite consumer traction for foods and supplements that are natural or ayurveda-based. “In India, health and wellness was a building trend. It’s now grabbing even more attention,” Sitaram said, adding that organic food companies will also do well.At Delhi-based Upakarma Ayurveda, co-founder Vishal Kaushik is also dealing with a surge in demand for its products, especially Ashwagandha, which helps the body cope with stress. The two-year-old brand is available at around 10,000 stores across 10 states and offers almond oil, shilajit resin and premium saffron. In the pipeline is Ayushkwath, a kadha (home remedy made from kitchen spices and herbs for cough and cold) recommended by the Ayush ministry to build immunity against covid.On popular demand, the company is also getting into chyawanprash, herbal juices like aloe vera, giloy and amla. For consumers who cannot afford the bigger juice packs, Upakarma is launching immunity building drops from ginger, tulsi, amla and giloy. Kaushik said the company has been growing at 100% a year and expects to maintain the pace.Surprisingly, figures on the size of the Indian market for ayurvedic products are hard to come by. Kaushik, however, estimates the international market, which is also turning to ayurveda wellness products, at $4.5 billion. The Indian market is growing at 30% a year, he said. With covid taking its toll, consumer demand for ayurvedic supplements has shot up and is likely to attract more startups to the space. Kaushik said all his vendors and suppliers are reporting a surge in queries and demand for raw material. The supply chain may see some shortages if demand spikes further. He also expects more private cultivators jumping into herbal plantations to meet this growing demand.Shuchi Bansal is Mint’s media, marketing and advertising editor.

Now suddenly you can't say that support will be $10,000. Your customers will churn. Or assume that you said at the time of signing early customers that all upgrades and updates are free. Now you have a GPT style AI version that came in, you will have to offer it to them for free. And that's going to be a huge cost to you.”These are the words of Shashank Bijapur, co-founder, and CEO of Spotdraft, a Contract Lifecycle Management company that helps companies simplify contract management from creation to execution to compliance. I spoke to Shashank to understand their journey from 0 to 100 customers, how they sell in the US from India, and the mistakes early-stage SaaS founders should avoid. I am sharing below his key insights and intuitions as he builds Spotdraft. I hope you enjoy them.Don’t send ‘lazy’ cold mails, ask for the prospect’s time (not dollars), and nail down your ICP before starting active sales.Spotdraft had some clients in India but hadn’t sold in the US market. Instead of going for ‘random acts of GTM’ (a term I heard recently from Anurag Wadehra, a renowned start-up coach and advisor) and spending real dollars on active selling, they started an intense customer discovery process to identify their ICP. They sent out over 800 mails in over 3 months to in-house counsels across multiple verticals/sectors, with ~10% conversion to customer discovery calls.What improved their conversion rate? Instead of being lazy and blasting the same message to all types of prospects, Spotdraft’s founders customized these mails. Firstly, these mails were sent from founders’ inboxes, which makes a lot of difference in people choosing to respond. Secondly, they didn’t use these mails to sell Spotdraft’s software. Instead, they went in with the clear intention of learning about the market from them. Lastly, they personalized the mails for each recipient. They researched the recipients and started with an attention-capturing hook rather than straightaway jumping into asking them to get onto a call.Shashank: “These were hyper specific emails. So the emails would almost be like Rohit, lets say you have Max as your dog and you put up a photograph on social media. So the mail will almost be like Hey, I just saw your photograph with your dog Max, and I love it, by the way. I also have a Labrador who's eight years old. The reason I'm writing you this email is because I am on this journey to launch our contract management product in the US. So I'm trying to get in touch with legal leaders like you to learn from you and understand what your current pain points are and how you're solving them. Just to be clear, this is not a sales email. I really want to learn. And that was the intention that we would go with.”Here’s sample content from one of their mails.Subject: (Personalized)Hi (First Name),(Personalized Relevance Hook)My co-founder and I are considering expanding our Al-driven legal tech startup, SpotDraft into the U.S. market.Before making any potentially costly decisions, I'm trying to learn from leaders like you as it relates to the biggest challenges you may have around cross-functional collaboration and contract compliance (and if you use any Al/machine learning tech).Also, this isn't a veiled pitch, just really seeking to learn from people like you. Happy to share any insights learned from your peers too.Excited to hear from you, (First Name)!-Shashank&nbsp;The discovery calls indexed on a few questions that helped them go deep into the buyer persona.Do you have this pain point? How strong is it?How are you solving it right now?Is there a budget and ownership internally to solve it?Is it urgent for you to solve it?Also, they sampled the recipients carefully, targeting prospects across sectors, geos, company sizes, etc., to make the discovery process robust.Shashank: “We were experimenting with our ICPs. Some ICPs worked well. Some didn't work well. But we did have a robust way of identifying who we were sending our emails to. Looking back, we realised that why would a nasdaq listed company sign up to an unknown small company. We had to work with some comparables to start with.”Let go of your assumptions about your ICP sooner than later in the discovery process to save time and money.While their assumptions about the paint point’s existence were correct, the ICP they thought would have the greatest pain point was unwilling to consider them. They started with the enterprise segment but realized that enterprises were already using other software. Given the annual contracts, education, and internal change management, it is always harder to convert someone from another tool to a new one.Shashank: “Looking back, we could have handled things differently when we first noticed that the enterprise market wasn't the right fit for us. We should have quickly adjusted our focus to target mid-market or SMB instead. However, as founders, we sometimes fall victim to the gambler's fallacy. We invest more money or time to make up for what we've lost. We thought, \"Maybe we're looking at the wrong sector. Maybe it shouldn't be finance, but manufacturing.\" We could have minimized our losses by making the switch earlier. Instead of spending three months, we could have spent just one and moved on.”Outbound sales are a faster and more intentional way to validate your ICP than PLG or inbound sales.Spotdraft chose to go for outbound sales for a variety of reasons - they didn’t have a marketing function when they started that could churn content, they didn’t have the funds to spend on digital ads, and SEO has a long lead time before it becomes effective (for a while Spotdraft’s website wasn’t the first thing that came up when you searched Spotdraft contract management).But most importantly, they wanted to validate the pain point and nail the ICP fast, and Shashank believes there’s no faster way to do this than outbound sales.Shashank: “We wanted to validate the market faster. This is the faster way of doing things, where you ask leading questions, \"Do you have this problem? This is what I'm building. And all founders must know this is the best way to do it. We also wanted to experiment with who our ICP is instead of the reverse, where people are coming to us through our website, and we say, \"Ah, this is our ICP. So to identify that, we had to go to every cohort, like mid-market, SMB, mid-level person, top-level person, venture-funded, and traditional businesses. We had to run that entire gamut of experiments to realize which one made sense.”Don’t offer custom low pricing forever, worry more about the future price than today’s price, and create a pricing model that has scope for future expansion revenue because raising prices yearly is not easy.Here are some common pricing mistakes that Shashank wants you to avoid.You should have an end date and an internal thesis on transitioning out of ‘not indexing on price’ and offering highly custom prices to prospects to close a deal. While it’s a good thing to do early on if you do it for a long time, your pricing will be all over the place, and you’ll end up leaving a lot of money on the table. For Spotdraft, they stopped doing this at around 30 customers.You’ll often hear that you should not worry about price in the &lt;$1M ARR zone. You have a fledgling product, and you should focus on acquiring customers to get product feedback and build the product, as you can always increase the price later. However, Shashank believes that you cannot increase your price manifold suddenly, and you should be more concerned about where you want your price to be, not today but in a few years.Shashank: “I felt like we could have been a little more bullish on how strongly we went in with pricing. I may not have been in the best, in the most bullish frame of mind when we were doing pricing. So I would always go in with a little bit of hesitation. And the instruction I had given was, no matter what, we'll figure out a way to work. Somehow we'll make it work in our budget. Because at that point, you also don't know what is the real market value of what you're trying to sell.Increasing the price is difficult because once you hit the baseline, you can only go to 20 %, 30 % higher the next year. In an ideal world, you want the pricing to increase because of usage, not because the year has changed. So a great pricing model is where the usage will end up determining how much they need to pay, and that's built-in. So you not only need to think through what your price is today but how you want your price to grow in the next few years and then set your current price like that.”At an early stage, your pricing model should leave scope for future expansion and revenue growth. So, what you offer at a price point is more important than the price itself. If you offer 10,000 API calls monthly (to sweeten the deal for your customer), but your customer uses only 1000 API calls monthly, you lose out on future expansion revenue because the customer will not have any need to move to a higher tier or buy any add-ons in their current tiers, as they cannot even fully use the value in their current tier.Shashank: “You can't take back any features that you've already given. For example, if I said support is free, unlimited support tickets because my UI is bad, and my product is still in development, but I can offer unlimited support to a customer with real people answering questions. Now suddenly, you can't say that support will be $10,000. Your customers will churn. Or assume that you said at the time of signing early customers that all upgrades and updates are free. Now you have a GPT-style AI version that came in, you will have to offer it to them for free. And that's going to be a huge cost to you.”During the discovery phase, be deliberate about qualifying prospects to the sales funnel, keep the discovery call separate from the sales call, and don’t over-index on price.Your early customers will fall into one of the following three buckets. Bucket three is the hardest to convert, and bucket two is the easiest.Shashank: “(Bucket 1) people who are currently looking at an alternative. They were looking at one of our competitors and said, “hey, I'm just about to close with X.” I said, okay, if you're about to close with X, go ahead and close it. We are also trying to see how we compare against our peers. So would you like to see a demo of our product and tell us how we fare?(Bucket 2) The second cohort was, hey man, great timing. We're actually looking for this. Like we desperately need something, let's go ahead and see your product.(Bucket 3) And the third was where they were extremely tired of the current way of doing things and wanted to look at alternatives. So they already had a tool in place that did not work well.”Shashank suggests that even during the customer discovery phase, you should be alert to see if there are people who could be potential customers and move them from the discovery process to the sales process. After all, you are a scrappy startup and shouldn’t let go of a potential customer.They qualified such prospects by looking through the BANT lens (Budget, Authority, Need, Timing). Here’s where Shashank believes that need is the most important factor, more important than timing.Shashank: “So need is the strongest pull. And then comes budget, then comes authority, then comes timing. Some will say timing comes first, but if there is a need, then the timing is right. That's our understanding.”He also recommends keeping the discovery and sales calls separate during the customer discovery process and even afterwards when you are actively selling.Shashank: “The first discovery call is, what's the problem? What are your symptoms? How are you solving it right now? And then, you schedule the follow-up surgery or anything else required. In most sales conversations, there's always a robust discovery process where you qualify or disqualify a prospect and then move forward.”Spotdraft didn’t mind selling at a discount to their early customers (especially in bucket 3, as they had switching costs). Instead of a higher price, they indexed on getting feedback from these early customers and co-opt them into product development.Shashank: “So we would tell the new customer, hey, you promise that once a week, 1 hour you're going to spend on how you use the tool and what you did right and wrong, that for us is more important than getting money when you have just started selling.”Selling is not the hardest part. The real challenge starts once a deal is closed.Shashank believes the real challenge for an early-stage startup isn’t selling the product but what happens after a customer signs up - onboarding and collecting feedback to build the product. Happy customers mean more potential customers because of the network effect of the word-of-mouth that travels. He recommends building these systems even before you’ve made the first sale.For instance, in the first few months, Spotdraft was still building a customer onboarding and activation process/team to ensure the customers were using the product and aware of its features.Secondly, while they wanted to collect feedback from early customers, they didn’t have a robust feedback collection system to channel it into the product roadmap right out of the gate, and it took them time to build it. And then there were other teething issues.Shashank: “When an Indian company starts selling to US customers, you need to take care of a lot of things. For instance, what’s the right way to accept payments in USD, how to properly take care of TDS and other tax-related things, how long remittances will take to hit our accounts, whom to talk to if a remittance gets stuck somewhere, etc. While now there are people here who know this like the back of their hands, early on, it took us a couple of months to figure all these things out.\"Transitioning from founder-led sales requires more than knowledge sharing. You will need to tweak your messaging, as the messaging that works when a founder does a demo will not work when someone else does it.As a founder doing early sales, don’t expect to flip a switch and expect someone else to take over from you. Your transition plan should include the sales leaders shadowing you and then you drawing guidelines for the types of calls you will do and the ones that sales org should do.Shashank: “So Akshay, who is our VP of Sales, would join me on calls. Once he started joining me on calls, I weaned off these calls and Akshay took over. I would join may be some calls where the decision-maker was joining so the team wanted me to be there. So the number of calls I had to do dropped by half. Then we hired more account executives on our teams. They started joining my VP of Sales on calls. Then that knowledge sort of spread.”As you make this transition, you’ll also need to rework your messaging from the cold mails (because these aren’t going from founders now) to demo calls.Shashank: “Then we realized the things that work for founder-led sales, both in terms of messaging that goes out in emails to what really happens on those calls. It doesn't work. So then we started doing value-driven emails, like, outcome-driven emails like, hey, how would you like to, I don't know, save 80% time managing contracts? So that's how we started. We experimented a lot with different types of mail like we started sending memes, we started sending... We said, Hey, if you get on the call, we'll give you a $50 Amazon gift card, incentivizing them. That didn’t work well, which is obvious in hindsight.”When you scale from 10 to 100 customers and beyond, outbound sales will plateau. Hence, it is important to bring inbound sales into the mix and set up a formal marketing function to keep the sales engine revving.Shashank shares that outbound sales cannot scale beyond a point. While 75 of Spotdraft’s first 100 customers came from outbound sales, they saw a significant decrease in conversions from emails sent to paid customers as they scaled.For one, there are rate limiters. For instance, you cannot send unlimited cold mails to prospects as Google will start marking you as spam. Similarly, you cannot send unlimited automated LinkedIn messages as LinkedIn caps them. That limits how wide a net you can cast once you are past the early adopters. Also, when mails stop going from founders and founders stop coming to the calls, there’s a natural drop in the percentage of people who respond to you.Shashank: “You also can't keep sending the same message over and over again because, then again, it is labeled as marketing or promotion, or spam. An email has to land in somebody's inbox. That person should be interested, should have a need, and then they should open that email and respond to that email. Only then it comes. It's a volume game, but it is rate limited by how, let's say, Gmail functions as a thing. And it's not only one email you need to send multiple follow-ups. There's a drip campaign that goes by.The propensity to come on to calls reduced. We didn't realize that this was because the founders were not coming.”Spotdraft set up a formal marketing function at this time (100 customers mark) and ramped up their inbound marketing. They invested in creating content - case studies, video podcasts, and white papers, and using ads to drive prospects to them. But the channel that’s given them the best return is events. This is because the legal industry is already heavily driven by events that see a strong presence of legal counsels, Spotdraft’s ICP.Shashank: “We started doing events. Legal technology is a very event-heavy business. We also started doing ads. Linkedin ads, Google ads, and video ads. We started doing a lot more SEO. We started getting ourselves listed on all these G2 and Capterra type comparison websites. All of these things started happening. While the intensity of outbound didn't reduce, we started getting a lot more inbound than outbound. Outbound started stagnating, but we weren't really affected by it because inbound took over and did probably 3X of what outbound was doing.\"An important point Shashank mentions is that while the sales funnel is split into inbound and outbound from an attribution perspective, what is important is to have a strong share of voice in whichever market you operate, as all these touchpoints come into play when closing a deal.Shashank: “Probably what ended up happening was you saw an ad, you saw a friend download it, you're watching cricket, and their ads were there on the fence. Then you saw some tweets. Then you saw some other review that somebody wrote about it or a news article. All of that led to you one day downloading the app.So outbound, while it is now a smaller portion of what we do, plays a very significant role in conversion. When we do ads, we do events, the same person is shown an email, then added to our newsletter, subscribes to our podcast, and then sends a demo request. So the end result may be like inbound there. But the actual reason could also be an outbound email that was sent like three months ago.”As you scale from 10 to 100 customers, avoid selling unlimited everything and set guardrails for things you’ll not do as you scale.One of the things Shashank cautions early-stage founders not to do is to sell anything that is prefixed by ‘unlimited’ as you may end up with that one customer who actually demands everything unlimited and takes out all engineering and product development bandwidth.Shashank: “We initially did deals where we gave unlimited of everything under the understanding that you can't eat unlimited. But what we did not anticipate is that people were not making prudent decisions as it wasn’t costing them anything. When we asked them, what do you want to implement? They'll give us two contract types. We implement that, and they’ll send two more contract types. So the delivery was a continuous delivery and continuous integration process.”Another thing he suggests founders should do mindfully is to be very mindful of what they’ll say no to as they scale. Saying yes to everything becomes a huge distraction as you grow and doesn’t help the product evolve.Shashank: “Most SaaS products need to integrate with other products. Now, our stance was not to say no to a customer for an integration. So any integration with any tool, we'd say yes. Now, people wanted to integrate with tools that they had built internally that even they didn't have any documentation on. There was no proper API, so delivery became a problem.I think we have greatly reduced this over a period of time. We now know for sure what we are definitely not going to build. We will not build anything that is on-premise. We will not build anything that is that does not have at least five open customer requests. For anything to be built, we should have lost deals worth a certain dollar amount else it’s not worth building.”Just so that you know, Spotdraft isn’t a Blume Portfolio company.Sigh!Rohit Kaul leads marketing and branding for Blume Ventures.

They also hint at opportunities for businesses to meet consumers’ growing demands in other areas, experts say.Gallup also found, for example, that most young, Black and Asian consumers still want brands to speak out on issues that matter to them. And a majority of respondents overall said businesses should speak out on the specific issues of climate change and mental health.Religion, abortion, political candidates and international conflict were particularly verboten, on the other hand, with fewer than 30% saying brands should address these topics.Rather than speaking out on issues, respondents said they wanted companies to make a positive impact by providing employees with fair wages and quality healthcare benefits, avoiding major pay gaps between chief executives and lower-level employees, and operating in an environmentally sustainable way.Eighty-eight percent of respondents said businesses have some power or a great degree of power to make a ;positive impact on people’s lives. ;But only 8% believe they have been extremely effective in doing ;so, with 50% saying they have been somewhat effective.“Most U.S. adults ;think businesses are not delivering ;on the core functions of what they think a business is for,” said Zach Hrynowski, a research consultant at Gallup. “That feeds into why people are less likely to want to hear from businesses, because they just don’t trust them.”Messaging is not enough to counter consumers’ dissatisfaction with the effects of real-world business practices, said Richard Edelman, CEO of his namesake public-relations network, Edelman.“The American public wants action from business and not just communication and advocacy,” he said.Culture war conundrumThe heightened cultural tensions that have put marketers under pressure aren’t going anywhere, said Cynthia E. Clark, professor of management at Bentley University, who contributed to the report.“You need to have a very thoughtful approach to speaking out, because what’s happening right now, in this moment, is when you speak out you may be entering into a culture war,” Clark said. “We have red and blue states; are we going to have red and blue companies?”The declining consumer interest in brand activism in Gallup’s survey was driven largely by self-described Democrats. Sixty-two percent of Democrats told researchers that brands should speak out, down from 75% last year. Thirty-six percent of independents said the same, down from 40% a year earlier, as did 17% of Republicans, down from 18%.Edelman has also reported some warning signals for marketers that are considering taking stands on issues.The number of consumers who said they are more likely to buy from or advocate for brands that share their own values dropped to 52% in June from 65% a year before, with the largest decline among self-described Republicans, according to Edelman’s most recent Trust Barometer report.In order to take a public stance on an issue, brands must be ready to demonstrate that issue’s relevance to their own operations, said Edelman.“You may still get blowback from people on the right or the left, but you have to withstand it and explain, it’s core to our business,” he said.Agreement on sustainability and AIDespite abundant evidence of division, a few controversial topics do inspire something approaching consensus.Fifty-five percent of respondents in the Gallup survey said brands should speak out on sustainability. That ;may be ;because businesses have a more demonstrable effect on climate change than on other sociopolitical matters, said Hrynowski, the Gallup research consultant.“The public sees business as having a role in that conversation by virtue of what a business does,” he said.Yet even opinions on that topic largely fall along political and generational lines, with younger consumers and self-described Democrats significantly more likely than Republicans and older adults to say that businesses have a negative effect on the environment.Respondents are even more united in believing that artificial intelligence will ultimately have a negative effect on society thanks, in large part, to the expectation that it will eliminate jobs.Seventy-nine percent of respondents in the Gallup survey said they don’t trust businesses much, if at all, to handle AI responsibly, a sentiment echoed in the survey regardless of age, education, ethnicity or ;political affiliation. Just one in 10 said AI would do more good than harm.“If consumers don’t trust business in general, then they’re more likely to believe that companies will use AI in ways that hurt workers, especially since they don’t fully understand AI itself,” said Hrynowski.Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com", "Published_Date": "2023-10-10T16:59:26+05:30"},

However, the big challenge is likely to be one of showcasing where multiple films are vying for space on the same weekend with filmmakers possibly negotiating for better deals. ;While Dharma Productions’ Mr & Mrs Mahi set the ball rolling last weekend, Kartik Aaryan-starrer Chandu Champion is scheduled for 14 June, followed by multi-lingual period drama Kalki 2898 AD at the end of the month.Later in July, Kamal Haasan will arrive with Indian 2, a sequel to his 1996 hit, while another established franchise Pushpa 2, is slated for the Independence Day weekend.Also Read: Beyond blockbusters: Leveraging international festivals for theatrical success“It is fair to say that it has been a relatively dull summer for theatres in terms of Bollywood releases, especially when compared to the robust performance in the August to December 2023 period,” Devang Sampat, managing director, Cinepolis India said. ;\"The number of Bollywood movies released this summer has been notably lower, and there has been a clear lack of blockbuster content in the Hindi film category. This reduction in high-profile releases has certainly impacted footfalls in theatres,” Sampat said. ;Sampat, however, pointed out that the situation has not been entirely bleak with regional movies, like Adujeevitham, Manjummel Boys, Aranmai 4, Star, Aavesham, Shinda Shinda No Papa and Nach de Ghuma having drawn attention and audience. ;Also Read: Cinemas play with prices, from  ₹99 a ticket to buy-one-get-one-freeAshish Saksena, chief operating officer, cinemas, BookMyShow, said Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kochi, Hyderabad, Delhi-NCR, Pune, Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur and Coimbatore have emerged as the top cities for booking tickets on the platform over the past quarter.With the elections wrapping up in the first week of June, the Hindi film industry is gearing up for an exciting slate of releases, added Sampat who named Kalki among the most anticipated films while calling Pushpa 2 a highly awaited sequel in a franchise that has already captured massive audience interest.Amit Sharma, managing director, Miraj Entertainment, which operates multiplex theatres was quick to point out that a lot of studios and production houses missed the bus when it came to the past few weeks over the summer.Also Read: Manjummel Boys sets a new trend for southern films: mega success at home ;“What we could see now is a certain amount of cannibalization with multiple movies every week and much conversation around inadequate showcasing. This when we waste eight weeks between April and June,” Sharma said. ;Both Kalki and Pushpa have the potential to earn  ₹500 crore each, Sharma said. But the bigger worry is for instance, in several weeks of July, two to three films will clash at the box office. ;On 5 July, Jahnvi Kapoor-starrer Ulajh, Karan Johar’s Kill and Ajay Devgn’s Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha are all scheduled to arrive in cinemas. On 12 July, John Abraham’s Vedaa will compete with Akshay Kumar’s Sarfira and Kamal Haasan’s Indian 2. A week later, Karan Johar will release his comedy drama Bad Newz.That said, several trade experts are sceptical of Hindi cinema’s ability to make a mark despite the resumption of releases. The slate that is peppered with mid-budget, content-driven films is unlikely to make a mark in tier-two and tier-three markets, they say. ;“People are looking forward to good commercial cinema and the only Hindi film that holds some promise is Singham (slated for October for now),” said independent exhibitor Vishek Chauhan, adding that southern films like Pushpa and Kalki are likely to help business in the Hindi-speaking belt though. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-03T11:03:16+05:30"},

It doesn’t speak well of either India or the MMT brand,” he said.Merely getting visibility out of an advertisement isn’t a yardstick of ‘success’ anymore, said Karthik Srinivasan, a communications strategy consultant. “The predominant tone of reaction matters too. From that point of view, there’s perhaps more negativity for the ad than positive. The ad’s intention was to provoke and it was wholly intentional, I think. While it was in poor taste overall, I hardly think it went ‘wrong’ though, from the reactions. It is hugely polarizing, with people taking opposing sides,” he said.Over a dozen companies put out advertisements with the cricket World Cup being their focus, many of which were appreciated by users.Cricket writer and broadcaster Joy Bhattacharjya posted on Facebook that the Pakistani team had a set of decent cricketers, many of whom were regarded as heroes much like Virat Kohli.

In the case of the services, other than the film being streamed by them after theatrical release, they will begin to have a stake from the time the film arrives in cinemas. Media and entertainment industry experts say this is another experiment aimed at better monetization at a time when services are trying everything from subscriptions and advertising to pay-per-view rental offers to improve profitability. Also, movies first premiering in theatres will come with some sort of buzz and allow platforms to control what they would have paid the producers for simple acquisition and no actual share in the IP (intellectual property) rights.Also read | OTT platforms ride on foreign markets for returns from big-budget titles“The fact that the buzz around theatrical release helps the prospects of the film is one of the core reasons (for our foray into theatrical productions).

So, it makes sense to back a film right from the beginning that can eventually stream on the service. hoichoi has about three films releasing in theatres over the next few months.OTTs are putting money into a film with multiple benefits, said Sandeep Bansal, managing director, Chaupal OTT.

Called ISEC, the new system is in line with the changing contours of the Indian household, which is more educated and has greater female participation in the workforce, the MRSI said on Wednesday.Unlike the earlier new consumer classification system (NCCS), which only factored in the education of the chief earner and the presence of certain consumer durables in the household, ISEC (Indian Socio Economic Classification) will factor in the occupation of the chief earner, and the education levels of the most highly educated adult male and adult female.Since GDP, income levels, penetration of consumer durables, and ownership of vehicles have increased significantly, the earlier classification system has become less useful. The need to redefine key variables led to the formation of a more stable and robust construct, MRSI said.Socioeconomic classification helps brands and agencies better understand their target audience’s profile and behaviour, and launch products, innovations and ad campaigns accordingly. Such data is especially critical in a diverse, populous market such as India. ISEC is \"representative of India’s socioeconomic strata” and captures both urban and rural household data, MRSI said.Sunil Kataria, CEO of Raymond Lifestyle, India and international, and chairman of The Indian Society of Advertisers, said, “The economy is developing at a rapid pace. At such a pace it is even more important for us as advertisers to understand our consumers and their behaviour. ISEC is representative, relevant and robust. It gives us a holistic view of our audience segment and how they are equipped to make decisions.”Industry stakeholders that are on track to adopt ISEC include The Indian Society of Advertisers, researchers at various organisations such as ITC, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Marico and Dabur India, research agencies including Kantar and IPSOS, and media agencies.Amit Adarkar, CEO, Ipsos India, said, “Socioeconomic classification is the starting point for any planning or decision-making, and impacts almost all industries. NCCS was introduced at the time when digitisation was gaining momentum and women’s representation in household decisions was marginal. Our country has evolved greatly since then and it’s essential that we have an SEC that is equally evolved.”The new classification system has been created by experts from across the research and insights industry and allows for \"improved distribution” and sharper and more refined targeting of consumer cohorts.“A better and deeper understanding of consumer cohorts is always appreciated. It gives brands the opportunity to identify and target consumers in a sharper manner and opens up avenues for sharper communications,” said Shashi Sinha, CEO, IPG Mediabrands India. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-02-21T19:23:09+05:30"},

Consequently, endorsement by celebrities gives an impression that indulging in such activity is acceptable. Engaging in the promotion or advertisement of online gambling and betting, given its unlawful status in the majority of the states, renders one equally liable for participating in an illegal activity. Hence, celebrities and influencers are advised to refrain from endorsing and promoting illegal betting and gambling activities,” the CCPA said in its advisory.The agency, which comes under the nodal ministry of consumer affairs, reiterated that promoting or advertising any illegal activities in itself is also illegal. “It is hereby cautioned that any advertisement or endorsement, whether directly or indirectly, of activities which are otherwise prohibited by law, including but not limited to betting or gambling, through advertisements or promotions, shall be subject to rigorous scrutiny,” it added.Mint had earlier reported that more than a dozen celebrities including cricketers, commentators and Bollywood stars were continuing to endorse betting platforms.

Deol will be seen in a Tamil film with Suriya titled Kanguva and will also appear in a Telugu project starring Nandamuri Balakrishna. Meanwhile, Dutt who has featured in titles like KGF: Chapter 2 and Leo, will be seen in Telugu action film Double iSmart scheduled to release this week. Khan, who was recently seen in multilingual mythological flick Adipurush, will play the antagonist in Jr NTR-starrer Devara. Trade experts say while this is a way for established actors to reinvent themselves, the crossover also helps to gain wider audiences in the northern belt, improving traction for the film in question.Big stars turned to character roles after playing lead“There has been a scenario where a lot of big stars have turned to character roles after playing the lead in order to extend their longevity. When the heavy-lifting at the box office is done by someone else, it is easy for these stars to make the required impact in a reimagined avatar,” film distributor and exhibitor Akshaye Rathi said. In case of recent southern films, while the Bollywood names shall play crucial parts, it is easy to mount the big-budget projects thanks to the presence of bankable southern stars such as Suriya and Jr NTR.

These are expected to build on the legacy of all-time blockbusters such as Baahubali 2: The Conclusion and KGF: Chapter 2 that had earned  ₹510.99 crore and  ₹434.7 crore with their dubbed Hindi versions alone.Increasingly, filmmakers have realised that regional lines have blurred thanks to audiences discovering content across languages on OTT, film producer, trade and exhibition expert Girish Johar said. It is important for southern industries to grow their share of the market too and while a dubbed Hindi version of the film is one way to do it, getting faces familiar in the north will soon be more the norm than an exception, Johar added. Female actors like Deepika Padukone and Janhvi Kapoor shall feature in Telugu action films Kalki and Devara this year.Also Read: Co-producers of films spar over profit distribution, intellectual property rightsRahul Puri, managing director, Mukta Arts and Mukta A2 Cinemas, agreed that there is an appetite to see actors who already come with a certain amount of recognition and value, as characters as opposed to regular lead roles. Further, the fact that names like Deol and Khan have also appeared in web projects such as Aashram and Tandav alongside, prove that they are rediscovering themselves and that there is a chance for filmmakers to come up with more character-oriented roles for them. “The southern industries also try to get these actors on board for projects to establish better presence and recognition in the Hindi belt,” Puri added.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-12T17:08:18+05:30"},

Amanullah ;said advertisers should submit self-declaration forms confirming their compliance with cable TV rules and advertising codes before airing ads. These declarations must be uploaded to the Broadcast Seva portal before the ads are aired, it said. ;It also warned that endorsers, including celebrities and influencers, would have equal liability for promoting deceptive products or services.The court tasked the consumer affairs ministry with establishing within four weeks a system for advertisers to submit self-declarations for print-media ads. ;Also read: Patanjali pulled up by the SC: Truth matters in advertisingThe court asked the ministry to file a fresh affidavit on the actions taken by the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) against false or misleading ads, particularly related to food and health.Patanjali caseThe court ordered the removal from stores of Patanjali products that have had their licences cancelled by state authorities, noting that suspended licences should result in immediate halting of sales. The court also criticised a state licensing authority for failing to ensure the removal of such products from shelves.Further, the apex court issued a notice to the president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr R.V. Ashokan, regarding a contempt plea initiated by Patanjali for his allegedly disparaging comments about the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court’s rebuke of Patajnali stems from a plea the IMA filed against the company and its founders, Baba Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna, accusing them of running a smear campaign against modern medicine.Also read: Patanjali’s credibility crisis: A knock-on effect on the booming Ayush market?In previous hearings, the court had expanded the scope of the case to include misleading ads concerning ‘cures’ by other FMCG companies. It also directed various union ministries and state departments to examine violations of the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, Drugs and Cosmetics Act, and the Consumer Protection Act, making these ministries party to the ongoing case.IMA’s lawsuit highlighted concerns about Patanjali spreading misinformation and disparaging modern medicine with unverified claims, citing various controversial statements by Ramdev, including those regarding covid vaccines and oxygen cylinders during the pandemic’s second wave.On 21 November 2023, the court warned Patanjali it would be fined  ₹1 crore if it did not stop circulating misleading claims and ads about modern medicine. Despite the ruling, Patanjali issued a media statement the following day denying it had made misleading claims about its products.On 27 February, the court issued a contempt notice to Ramdev and Balkrishna and barred Patanjali from promoting products with unsubstantiated claims of curing diseases such as heart conditions and asthma. It also banned the company and its officials from disparaging any medical system through any media.On 19 March, Ramdev and Balkrishna were directed to appear in person before the court to respond to the contempt proceedings against them. On 16 April, the court gave them a week to tender a public apology for issuing misleading advertisements for health cures.Also read: Patanjali misleading ads: Ramdev, Balkrishna issue second ‘bigger’ apology following Supreme Court stare-down", "Published_Date": "2024-05-07T17:50:03+05:30"},

This is of particular concern, making for heavy-handed regulations that would potentially restrict freedom of expression. Yet, given that Vaishnaw also holds the electronics and IT portfolio, the industry hopes for a better understanding of how content should be managed or regulated across platforms, while addressing issues like deepfakes and misuse of artificial intelligence.Read | Multiplexes see F&B revenue growth beat ticket salesEngaging with stakeholders“The broadcasting regulation bill, which aims to regulate broadcasting services in India, could face several potential problems and challenges. Engaging with stakeholders and considering their concerns during the formulation and implementation of the bill will be essential to address these potential problems effectively,” Ashlesha Gowariker, senior partner at Desai & Diwanji said.Implementing a uniform regulatory framework across diverse platforms and content types, including TV, radio, and OTT could be challenging, Gowariker said, adding that broadcasters, especially smaller ones, might face difficulties in complying with complex regulatory requirements, leading to increased operational costs. Stringent regulations might create entry barriers for new players, stifling innovation and reducing competition while potential investors may be wary of investing in a heavily-regulated market. Meanwhile, there could also be apprehensions about increased censorship and control over content, potentially stifling freedom of expression and creativity.A senior broadcaster who did not wish to be named said that the industry is waiting to see if Vaishnaw’s experience with IT and electronics will ensure better understanding of how content should be managed across various platforms. “There is both fear and hope, as we try and address reasons that the Indian M&E (media and entertainment) sector hasn’t really been able to meet its potential yet,” the person added.Issue of press freedomAt a recent meeting, members of the Press Club of India had noted that sweeping provisions under laws such as the proposed Broadcast Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, the Press and Registration of Periodicals Act, 2023, and the Information Technology Amendment Rules, 2023, which gives the government powers to remove any online content pertaining to its business that it deems to be false or misleading, are meant to silence the press. \"The government will have to ensure that proposed future laws should not impede press freedom, while upholding the right to privacy of citizens. The existing laws and future legislations should not be leveraged to block or take down legitimate news content across platforms such as print, television and Internet,\" the body said in a statement.Also this | Mid-budget movies punch above their weight at the box officeBringing both the ministries of electronics and IT as well as information and broadcasting under the charge of Vaishnaw appears to be a good omen for the M&E sector, which has shown increasing signs of converging with, and dependency on, new tech, Aarushi Jain, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said. “Some clarity on AI-related use, possibly stringent measures for protection against deepfakes in upcoming digital laws will be a welcome move for the M&E industry which seems to be grappling with such issues,” Jain said.Fake news problemFurther, curbing fake news remains a work in progress. Jasmine Damkewala, senior partner at Circle of Counsels, said the ministry of information and broadcasting has often pointed out that programmes need to adhere to the Programme Codes and Advertising Codes under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and that the programmes cannot be obscene, defamatory, deliberately false or containing suggestive innuendo and half-truths. “However, the said regulation is mostly implemented ex post facto after the incident, reason being that the news or programme does not run through a check or censuring prior to the telecast as in the case of a certification for a movie. Accordingly, fake news has till now remained an unchartered and unremedied arena where much reform is wanting,” Damkewala added.Online piracy challengesTo be sure, multiple challenges remain with respect to film production and exhibition as well. For one, the Indian Copyright Act, 1956, enables a general safeguard against copyright violation as far as theatrical films go. However, several issues related to online piracy persist, such as procedural delays caused in Indian courts which result in a continuous loss of revenue. Also, even after a court orders removal, the content sometimes persists on the Internet, causing further financial loss.“The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is responsible for certifying films for public exhibition. However, the process has been criticized for being subjective, and sometimes arbitrary, leading to delays and disputes over cuts or changes demanded by the board. The government periodically offers tax incentives and rebates to promote film production and incentivize investment in the industry. These incentives are typically offered at the state level, and may include exemptions from entertainment tax or other financial benefits for filmmakers. But there is no overarching central framework for this, and little clarity on future initiatives,” Vikram Jeet Singh, partner, BTG Advaya, explained.And this | Reboots of old hit songs aid movie marketing as new tracks fail to draw", "Published_Date": "2024-06-17T16:27:07+05:30"},

Ltd which owns MuscleBlaze and HealthKart and firms like Unacademy and FirstCry.Interestingly, betting and gambling companies have overtaken healthcare firms that are making false claims of magical remedies as the most violative ads this year, said the report.A majority or 85% of all complaints made against false and misleading advertisements last year were made for those appearing on digital platforms.Of all the ads listed, over 1,300 ads of illegal betting were reported to the information and broadcasting ministry, along with about 150 ads of liquor promotion and e-cigarettes and vapes, said ASCI. About 1,250 ads were reported for drugs and magical remedies to the ministry of Ayush. Nearly 250 advertisers were reported during the year for a potential violation of the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, 1954 (DMR).Most of these were website advertisements from marketplaces and 91% of these ads were in violation since they dealt with maintenance and enhancement of \"sexual prowess\".Advertising for several products is prohibited by various laws in the country. For instance, advertisements for drugs that claim to offer \"miraculous cures\", betting and gambling services, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco products are all illegal. ;Digital ads ;These advertisements often appear on digital platforms, which many brands use to promote such products. Additionally, while some categories are outright banned from advertising, others, like real estate, must include specific information such as registration numbers and QR codes in their advertisements. Failure to provide this mandatory information also constitutes a legal violation.\"The number of ads that made a violation on digital mediums have gone up nearly three-fold in the last 3-4 years. This is because for many categories advertising has moved to the digital medium and also, unlike television, there are generally more ads in terms of volumes now than from a few years ago,\" Manisha Kapoor, CEO and secretary general of the council said.Recently Mint reported that the government was working on a three-ministerial taskforce to deal with violative advertisements to reign in the problems being caused by digitial ads. ;Also read: Patanjali soan papdi fails quality test, three fined and sent to prisonInterest in general, in the healthcare segment has grown post the pandemic, which has possibly led to many more advertisements in this category. ;Also, healthcare companies were earlier using hyperlocal and regional newspapers to advertise their products where they were possibly avoiding being caught. A lot of those businesses are advertising digitally now. ;Another large category that had violative ads was skin and personal care with 98% of the 1,000 plus ads, that ASCI looked into, needing to be amended. This segment that was called out was almost entirely advertising digitally too, with 95% of ads seen on digital media.

Kohli’s brand value soared to $227.9 million from $176.9 million in 2022, a notable 28.9% increase, according to corporate investigation and risk consulting firm Kroll’s latest ’Celebrity Brand Valuation’ report. However, his current valuation still lags his pre-pandemic high of $237 million. ;Read This: ‘Cost relief, improved consumption to boost ad industry in second half of 2024’Kohli’s diverse portfolio, comprising over 40 brands, spans various industries, including his recent signing as the brand influencer for HSBC India. ;Bollywood’s iconsThe report, titled ’Brands, Business, Bollywood Celebrity Brand Valuation report 2023’, highlighted film actor Ranveer Singh’s consistent growth in brand value over the past four years. Singh’s valuation nearly doubled, rising from $102.9 million in 2020 to $203.1 million in 2023. Despite slipping one rank this year, Singh’s brand value surpassed the $200 million mark for the first time. ;Singh, known for his storytelling prowess, has a robust portfolio of 50 brands, including Tiffany & Co. and Zomato during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023.

Despite this, 60% of Kumar’s endorsement portfolio has remained stable since 2020. Alia Bhatt also saw significant growth, with her brand value increasing by 110.6% over three years, maintaining a similar valuation to the previous year.Aviral Jain, managing director of valuation advisory services at Kroll, noted a 14% increase in endorsements by the top 20 celebrities, with overall brand value driven primarily by the top 10. \"We are seeing a sustained growth trajectory in terms of both overall brand value and endorsement fee, with an average increase of 6-7% in endorsement charges by the top 10 celebrities.\"Despite some fluctuations, the market remains robust. Two-thirds of the top 25 in brand valuation revenues are dominated by Bollywood stars, 28-29% are accounted for by sports figures, and the remaining few percentage points are represented by southern Indian celebrities.\"We are not really expecting many non-cricket sports personalities to break into the top 25 either,\" Jain said, adding that celebrity endorsements help many established players capture customers faster, while newer companies or startups gain quick visibility through these endorsements.Endorsements driving market reachThe methodology for ranking celebrity-endorsed products considers two main factors: the average fee paid for endorsements and the number of endorsement deals adjusted across brands. This provides a rating reflecting each brand’s ability to capitalize on recent popularity and success in their endorsements.Celebrity endorsements significantly impact long-term sales, as highlighted by Bonn Nutrients Pvt. Ltd’s recent signing of Katrina Kaif for their bread and ’Americana’ biscuit brands. ;“Roping in a celebrity doesn’t necessarily give us an immediate boost in sales but that’s the best route to market when a company needs to reach out to masses,” Dawinder Pal, group marketing head, Bonn Nutrients, had noted at the time of signing up the Indian celebrity.Kaif joined the list of India’s most valued celebrity brands at number 25, valued at $27.1 million.And This: A three-pronged taskforce in the works to rein in digital ads running amokThe report also examined the television presence of the top 25 celebrity brands, revealing that they were endorsed 311 products across 22 industry segments as of November 2023. Leading brands on television included Harpic toilet cleaner endorsed by Akshay Kumar, Lux soap by Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli, and Veet by Sara Ali Khan.The year 2023 saw a rise in Indian \"celebpreneurs,\" with Akshay Kumar launching his athleisure brand Force IX, Kareena Kapoor Khan introducing her Korean skincare brand ’Quench Botanics,’ and Deepika Padukone unveiling her luxury skincare brand 82°E. ;Additionally, Indian celebrities expanded their international presence, with alliances such as Katrina Kaif with Etihad Airways and Alia Bhatt as Gucci’s first Indian global ambassador. On the other hand, global celebrities aligned with Indian brands, marking a significant shift. Infosys, for instance, enlisted tennis champions Rafael Nadal and Iga Świątek, while Zomato partnered with cricket stars Chris Gayle.\"In 2024, we’ve started to see the beginnings of artificial intelligence being used in mainstream advertisements where AI is being used along with a celebrity to market products. This can help generate better RoIs for advertisers,\" Jain added.India’s media and entertainment sector saw an 11.4% growth in 2023, reaching $28 billion, driven by digital media, online gaming, and animation.

The new rules, which took effect on 18 June, aim to curb misleading ads but IAMAI argues they will instead hamstring the digital economy.IAMAI is a non-profit with about 600 members ranging from startups to multinational companies. In its petition, which Mint has accessed, it said that while it supported efforts to prevent false ads, the new self-declaration requirement would severely disrupt online advertising. It urged the court to reconsider the self-declaration rule, and called for consultations with the government to find a solution that protects consumers while supporting the growth of the digital economy. ;Also read: Confusion, website glitches mar first day of new ad rulesA spoke in the flywheelOne of IAMAI’s main concerns was that the new rules would slow down or even halt online ad campaigns. Online ads are crucial because businesses can track their performance in real time and make quick adjustments if needed. This flexibility helps companies target their audiences more effectively and boost sales, IAMAI said. The new rules, it added, would hinder this process, making online ads less effective and hurting revenue. Small and mid-sized companies will be hit the hardest as they rely heavily on online advertising and may not have the resources to comply with the new rules, it said.Also read: A three-pronged taskforce in the works to rein in digital ads\"The primary issue is with digital ads as their frequency is far [higher] than TV, print or radio ads. For instance, if a company puts up 20 digital ads a day, it will need significant resources to comply with the self-declaration rule. The [benefits] of digital ads – speed and quick calibration – will be hampered. There is also the issue of what constitutes an advertisement and what does not. Many social media posts, for instance, may not necessarily be ads,\" Dhruv Garg, ; a tech policy and legal consultant based in Delhi told Mint.Enforce existing laws, says IAMAIThe industry body added that existing laws such as the Information Technology Act and the Consumer Protection Rules already have robust mechanisms to deal with misleading online ads. Stronger enforcement of these laws would better protect consumers than the new rules, it added.IAMAI’s petition highlighted the significant role online advertising has played in creating economic opportunities, especially during the pandemic, when many businesses were forced to shift online. It also cited a study by GroupM, which estimated that digital ads would account for 57% of total ad revenue in India in 2024.Also read: Targeted ads become focal point of digital competition debate", "Published_Date": "2024-06-20T13:57:56+05:30"},

Political parties must recognise that broadcasters have the freedom to decide what to telecast and such editorial freedom cannot be subject to any interference,” the NBDA said in a statement.The boycott of channels is not the way forward and alludes to a threat to the freedom of the press, the NBDA said. It noted that such arbitrary action has far-reaching consequences on the business of broadcasters, causing daily losses and impacting viewership adversely and thereby affecting the channel’s ratings and its advertising revenue. It also has long-term implications on the relationship between broadcasters and advertisers.Also Read: News TV kicks into high gear as elections rolls onThe blackout had raised serious concerns about press freedom as it came on the day of the election results and amid reports of political pressure being brought upon cable operators to block these news channels due to the change in the political leadership in Andhra Pradesh, NBF said in a statement.“Andhra Pradesh is the largest market in terms of television consumers, with over 65 lakh viewing news via their set-top-boxes. The news channels, serving in public interest, were removed from at least 62 lakh boxes, denying right to information by the audience,” NBF said.The High Court’s intervention underscored the importance of maintaining an open and transparent media environment, essential for the functioning of a healthy democracy, it added.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T14:06:45+05:30"},

A recent report by the Financial Times reveals that Yaccarino is now facing considerable pressure to slash costs and boost revenues.As per the report, in response to these pressures, Yaccarino has made several decisive moves within her executive team. Notably, she dismissed Joe Benarroch, her chief business operations and communications officer, who had been a close advisor.The report adds that sources within X indicate that Benarroch’s departure was largely due to his mismanagement of a new adult content policy rollout, which failed to adequately inform clients before its public announcement.Reportedly, this executive shake-up comes amid escalating tensions between Musk and Yaccarino. Having been recruited by Musk from NBCUniversal, Yaccarino is under immense pressure to stabilize X's financial standing. This has led to budget cuts across the US and UK sales teams and reduced expenditures on various fronts, including travel.Recently, an all-hands meeting at X, led by Yaccarino, was reported in the media. During the meeting, Yaccarino urged employees to support Musk’s new venture, x.AI, but provided limited information regarding X's advertising business performance. According to The Verge, employees were eager for updates on the company's performance reviews, which have been delayed without explanation, and expressed concerns over missing revenue targets for the quarter. Additionally, there have been recent layoffs within the company, contributing to staff anxiety.Steve Davis, CEO of The Boring Company and a close associate of Musk, has been closely examining the finances at X's San Francisco headquarters for several weeks, further heightening employee concerns.In this climate of uncertainty, employees sought clarity on the company’s performance review process and business metrics during the recent all-hands meeting.

Initially touted as a revolutionary device capable of replacing both smartphones and computers while providing customizable immersive and virtual environments, the Vision Pro has faced challenges, including a high price tag of $3,499 (approximately Rs. 2,92,200) and various reported issues.In response, Apple is now reportedly planning a multiproduct approach to bolster the popularity of its mixed-reality headset. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in his latest Power On newsletter, Apple's Vision team reevaluated their strategy and decided to develop a range of new devices across different price points instead of focusing on a single flagship product. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the discussions, the report outlines plans for two new versions of the headset and a successor to the Vision Pro.The first new variant is expected to be a simplified version of the Vision Pro, with fewer features and a more accessible price point between $1,500 (roughly Rs. 1,25,300) and $2,000 (roughly Rs. 1,67,000). This more affordable model, internally dubbed the Apple Vision and codenamed N107, could launch by the end of 2025. However, the main challenge for Apple is reportedly reducing production costs to meet this price target.Looking further ahead, Apple is also working on augmented reality (AR) glasses designed to be lightweight and resemble traditional sunglasses. This product, which remains largely under wraps, is tentatively slated for a 2027 release.In addition, Apple is developing the second generation of the Vision Pro, referred to as the Vision Pro 2 and codenamed N109.

At this price, the phone would compete with the likes of Realme P1, iQOO Z9x, Vivo T3 and the Poco X9 Neo.&nbsp;But is this the most balanced smartphone under  ₹20,000? Well, I have been using the Nord CE 4 Lite for a couple of days now, and below are my thoughts about OnePlus' cheapest smartphone during this limited usage period.&nbsp;Unboxing and design:&nbsp;Inside the box of OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, you get the device itself, some paperwork and transparent PU case which is bundled nicely inside a black cardboard packaging, a red coloured Type A to Type C cable and a 80W adapter.&nbsp;The phone comes in three color variants: Super Silver, Ultra Orange, and mega blue. I received the mega blue variant, which is a little too flashy for my liking.&nbsp;To the back of the phone, there is a pill shaped camera cutout, which houses the two rear cameras and the flash. The rear of CE 4 Lite has a glossy plastic which is very prone to fingerprints and smudges. I would strongly advice using the bundled case before you get your hands on the device.&nbsp;OnePlus has got rid of the curved textured panel it had for the Nord CE 4 with its younger sibling and has instead opted for a flat panel which makes the phone feel a little boxy and the sharp edges could be an issue while taking phone calls for long hours. Stay tuned for the full review to get an idea of how the CE 4 Lite performs in the long run.&nbsp;The Nord CE 4 Lite features an flat display with punch hole style notch mechanism. The phone comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner, a stereo speaker setup, a 3.5mm headphone jack, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.1and IP54 rating for splash and dust resistance.&nbsp;Display and software:&nbsp;The Nord CE 4 Lite features a 6.67-inch 120Hz AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels and a peak brighenss of 2100 nits (1200 nits in High Brightness Mode).&nbsp;The phone also comes with support for Aqua Touch feature which is claimed to improve usability when the screen gets wet during rainfalls or while using the device with wet hands. But my experience with the OnePlus 12 and later devices reveals that the feature has been a hit or &nbsp;a miss so far. We'll have to do a more thorough analysis of the Nord CE 4 Lite to see if OnePlus has worked on improving the implementation somehow.&nbsp;On the software front, the CE 4 Lite runs on Oxygen OS 14 running on the Android 14 operating system and security patch update will May 2024. The phone does come with some bloatware apps (9 to be exact) including Candy Crush, Bubble Pop, Tile Match, Myntra and LinkedIn, but all of these apps can be installed and there are no ads in the UI whatsoever.&nbsp;In general, Oxygen OS is not the most feature rich Android skin going around but it does offer a relatively cleaner user interface as compared to other Chinese smartphones on the market.&nbsp;Camera:The Nord CE 4 Lite comes with a dual-camera setup, including a 50MP Sony LYT primary sensor with OIS and a showpiece 2MP Mono sensor, which is said to improve portrait photos. For selfies and video calls, there is also a 16MP selfie shooter on the front.&nbsp;Performance:&nbsp;The Nord CE 4 Lite is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 5G chipset based on TSMC 6nm process, which is paired with Adreno 619 GPU for handling graphics-intensive tasks.&nbsp;The processor choice by OnePlus is disappointing to say the least, given that Snapdragon 695 is almost a 3-year-old chipset and was also used to power Nord CE 2 Lite and the Nord CE 3 Lite. In my opinion, OnePlus missed a trick here by not opting for a newer 4nm based Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 or MediaTek 7200 chipset which would have made it one of the most balanced devices under  ₹20,000.&nbsp;Processor choices aside, in terms of day-to-day usage, the phone did not throw up any issues and the . I also tried playing a few deathmatches on BGMI and Call of Duty Mobile and the gameplay was surprisingly smooth. A more thorough analysis of the device's performance, along with benchmark scores and comparisons, will follow in a more detailed review. &nbsp;Battery:&nbsp;The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite gets a 5,500mAh battery pack, a major boost from the 5,000mAh battery on its predecessor and takes the phone on par with other OnePlus devices launched this year like the 12R and the Nord CE 4.&nbsp;It comes with support for 80W fast charging, which is claimed to take the phone from 1-100% in about 52 minutes. In my limited testing with the CE 4 Lite, the phone took a little over 1 hour to fully juice up using the bundled charger.Price:&nbsp;The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is priced at  ₹19,999 for the 8GB RAM/128GB storage variant, while the top-end 256GB storage variant will sell for  ₹22,999. The phone can be bought from Amazon, OnePlus' own website, and the company authorized stores from June 27 onwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-24T20:49:11+05:30"},

Consider a scenario where the joint account holders invested in an MF equity linked savings scheme (ELSS) on 1 January 2023. &nbsp;Soon after &nbsp;the death of the primary holder in early 2024, the units are transferred to the second account holder's folio. There is a lock-in period of three years for ELSS MF but this is not valid post the transmission of units. What is the taxation if the survivor receives the MF units on 10 April and redeems it within 10 days?—GurtejinderFrom the facts provided, we understand that as per the joint holding policy of the fund (anyone or survivor), units of the ELSS fund would be transmitted to or inherited by the surviving account holder. Also, the lock-in period of three years is not applicable for the survivor. As per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, inheritance does not qualify as ‘transfer’ and hence, no capital gains would arise at the time of transmission of the MF units.As and when such units are further sold (subject to any specified lock-in provisions of the fund), the survivor would need to pay capital gains. Any gain or loss arising from sale of ELSS funds held for a period of more than 12 months prior to their sale is considered as long-term capital gain &nbsp;(LTCG) or long-term capital loss (LTCL). Else, the same shall be considered as short-term capital gain (STCG) or short-term capital loss (STCL).Cost indexationLTCG in excess of Rs1 lakh is taxable at the rate of 10%, whereas STCG is taxable at 15%. Please note that for calculating the period of holding of such inherited units, the period for which the asset was held by the previous holder, in this case, the deceased, shall be considered. For the purpose of calculating LTCG, the cost of acquisition shall be the actual cost borne by the deceased. Accordingly, since the period of holding exceeds 12 months for inherited and survivor’s share, the same shall be considered to be a sale of long term capital asset and any gains shall be taxable at 10% (for LTCG exceeding Rs1 lakh). No benefit of cost indexation is available while calculating tax on LTCG of such securities transaction tax (STT) paid ELSS.Also read: Income tax benefits on second home loan — ExplainedPlease note that the above is subject to the lock-in provisions applicable for the scheme.

That faith coupled with discounts and an about 7 percent drop in prices from an over five-year high in February is underpinning jewelers’ expectations for brisk sales.Retailers like Malabar Gold &amp; Diamonds are offering as much as 50 percent off on jewelry-making charges, while Tata Group’s Titan Co. is giving a discount of up to 25 percent. The charges vary from store to store and city to city and can contribute as much as 10 percent to the total cost of an ornament. Others are giving freebies such as Kerala-based Kalyan Jewellers, which said it is giving away gold coins for free to some customers.“Lower prices are expected to be a key trigger in pushing sales on a higher trajectory,” Ahammed MP, chairman of Malabar Gold &amp; Diamonds, said in a statement. “There are reports of robust pre-Akshaya Tritiya sales in the markets. A higher sales volume is expected as compared with last year and in percentage terms, we can expect sales growth of around 15-20 percent.”Gold demand in India is picking after slow sales in the last couple of years as higher prices and government curbs to crack down on unaccounted wealth weighed on the sector. Purchases in the second-biggest gold buying nation may be boosted this quarter because of the traditional wedding season purchases, the auspicious Akshaya Tritiya festival and rising crop prices, the World Gold Council said last week.People profiting from the equity market will also turn toward gold to diversify their portfolio, boosting demand for the precious metal, according to digital gold platform Augmont, which is offering buyers opting for home delivery of their gold purchases an equal amount of silver free during the festival.

The SIP inflows seemed to have held up despite an economic shock caused by the nationwide lockdown.However, a detailed analysis of the number suggests that bounced SIPs may not have been factored in. An SIP ‘bounce’ is a failure to debit the customer’s bank account for a scheduled SIP due to insufficient balance. Such a bounce in some cases attracts charges from banks.In a media presentation last month, Aashish Sommaiyaa, MD and CEO, Motilal Oswal AMC suggested that the AMFI monthly flow data should be crosschecked with the SIP assets under management (AUM) data, which is also disclosed by the same body. A mismatch between the two may be partially on account of bounced SIPs.The SIP AUM rose from  ₹2,75,983 crore in April to  ₹2,76,218 crore in May, which is a rise of just  ₹235 crore. However, monthly SIP flows disclosed by AMFI was several multiples higher at  ₹8,123 crore in May. So where did  ₹7,889 crore go?One explanation could be market drop which has the effect of reducing AUM. Over this period (1 May to 31 May) Sensex fell by 3.84% and Nifty fell 2.84%. \"I’m not sure if you can attribute Sensex decline and compare it to AUM decline. Equity scheme SIPs are across large, mid and small caps. The market movement can vary scheme to scheme,\" said a spokesperson for Computer Age Management Services (CAMS), a registrar and transfer agent.Only a detailed disclosure from AMFI will provide clarity on the matter.", "Published_Date": "2020-06-10T17:16:05+05:30"},

The company's artificial intelligence chatbot is powered by OpenAI's large multimodal language model GPT-4, which is adept in generating text from textual and visual input.“We have seen over 6,000 bookings made through 6Eskai over the website and mobile application.

Normally, these queries would have required the assistance of a customer service agent in the absence of AI.g.&nbsp;Following its deployment, Air India has managed to get a containment ratio of 93%, which means that only 7% of customer queries are escalated to a human agent.&nbsp;The airline's virtual agent handles over 1,300 topics and provides human-like responses and uses ‘general knowledge,’ which was absent in earlier versions of the AI-based tool, the airline said.Attaining tech supremacyAir India is in the process of incorporating computer vision technologies in its mobile application to enhance customer experience. It is also working on deploying artificial intelligence in a variety of marketing areas across its website and mobile application platform.“Besides the consumer use cases, we are using AI, in particular Generative AI, in core enterprise use cases. For example, we have developed a CoPilot plugin on Microsoft Teams, so that users can ask natural language questions about any specific areas of our function or performance,” an Air India spokesperson told Mint.Also Read: Air India aims to double transit international traffic“AI use will be pervasive in Air India,” the spokesperson added.

Ebitda refers to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.TVS Motor Company, on the other hand, reported revenues of  ₹8,169 crore for the quarter ended 31 March, exceeding the anticipated  ₹7,975 crore, even though its net income of  ₹485 crore fell below the expected  ₹530 crore because of a fair valuation loss on some of its investments. Its Ebitda of  ₹926 crore outdid the forecast of  ₹883 crore.Rise of first-time buyersNiranjan Gupta, CEO of Hero MotoCorp, told analysts in a post-earnings conference call that the company was seeing a promising increase in first-time buyers, particularly in their entry-level motorcycle segment.“(Consumer sentiment in) March was definitely positive. April was positive. The momentum is somewhat on even now. However, in May the marriage dates (which lead to greater demand for two-wheelers) are not there, but I think there is a bit of a jump in the first-time buyers. There is something happening in terms of consumer sentiment that people are prioritizing their personal mobility. Overall, therefore, we see it as positive momentum and it’s quite broad based across the regions that we’re seeing,” Gupta said.“The rural market is slowly and steadily changing; I’m able to see some recovery happening,” said K.N. Radhakrishnan, CEO of TVS Motor Company. “I’m hoping that this year, even though we are all going through very, very high temperatures, severe heat waves, I’m expecting the monsoon to be normal. I think that will definitely help the rural (sales) to move much faster. So, in FY25, we are hoping to see better recovery from rural, unlike what we have seen in the last year.”Electric two-wheelers drive optimismThe two-wheeler makers said they are also optimistic about the growth in the electric two-wheeler segment despite the reduction in consumer demand-related subsidies offered by the government, expecting to counterbalance this with benefits from the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the auto sector.While the current lineup of Vida EVs from Hero MotoCorp is not PLI ready, upcoming products expected in the first half of the year, or by the second quarter of FY25, will meet these criteria, marking a significant overhaul in Hero MotoCorp’s EV portfolio and also making it eligible to receive PLI benefits, the company said.“This quarter, the impact of spend on EV business on our margin was 130 basis points, reducing the overall Ebitda margin to 14%. Going forward, we will focus on volume growth, enhancing our premium portfolio, and double-digit growth in the parts business, alongside intensifying cost-saving measures across the value chain,” Gupta said. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.TVS Motor Company, on the other hand, said while it will expand its current iQube electric scooter range, it is also set to finally introduce an electric three-wheeler, despite currently lagging competitors like Bajaj Auto and Piaggio. “More options on the current iQube will be available very shortly. The new products, both in the IC-engine and EV segment, are in advanced stages and will definitely be introduced this financial year,” Radhakrishnan said, without explicitly stating which segments the products will address.\"Two-wheeler sales are expected to grow at a healthy rate of 8-9% in FY25. In the recent months, retail demand too has been encouraging. Margin performance of both Hero MotoCorp, TVS, and earlier Bajaj Auto, was healthy and inline to marginally above our and street estimates. The underlying ICE margins for two-wheeler players continue to remain strong, while there are headwinds in short-term EV margins but are eventually expected to improve with scale and cost reductions,” Jay Kale, senior vice president, Elara Capital, said. ;", "Published_Date": "2024-05-08T20:44:00+05:30"},

The last time a reading of this level was recorded was in February 2008, when the HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) had touched a high of 59.5.The growing need for warehouses in India’s Tier 2 and 3 cities to urbanization, economic expansion, the rise of e-commerce, organized retails, and government’s initiatives like ‘Make in India’ that attracts businesses toward these regions due to lower cost, said Nirav Doshi, Founder and Managing Director of NIDO Group, an intralogistics mechanization and automation solutions provider.NIDO aims to introduce two new models of unmanned goods movement system — AMRs and ASTRO — to enhance retrieval and fulfilment capabilities in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, he told us.Automation technologies like IoT and AI enable efficient warehouses which drives further demand of logistics in India, said Doshi, adding that the company caters to automation needs with scalable systems for small businesses, focusing on affordability and support.NIDO’s founder Doshi said that they offer warehouse automation solutions like AS/RS for robotic storage, Conveyor Systems for inventory flow, Robotics and AGVs for order fulfilment, WMS for inventory management, and IoT Sensors for real-time monitoring.For the last-mile delivery, the company’s automated sorting systems empower warehouses to swiftly organize items for delivery, while barcode scanning technology facilitates seamless tracking throughout the supply chain, he said, adding that this expertise enhances speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness in last-mile delivery operations and overall business growth. ;“By integrating robust automated solutions such as barcode scanning and RFID technology, we mitigate the pitfalls of manual data entry. Emphasizing last-mile delivery solutions, NIDO optimizes logistics, enhances supply chain efficiency, and ensures seamless operations, empowering businesses to thrive in today’s competitive market landscape,” Doshi said. ;He further stated that NIDO Group extends its cost-efficient automation solutions across diverse sectors including pharmaceuticals, groceries, fashion, e-commerce, and 3PLs. ;In addition, artificial intelligence also revolutionized warehousing with advanced capabilities as it forecast demand, optimize inventory levels, and streamline resource planning which can reduce stockouts, he asserted.“AI-driven automation enhances order fulfilment efficiency and accuracy. Customer service systems powered by AI offer real-time support. AI analytics provide insights for continuous operational improvement, adapting warehouses to changing demand patterns effectively,” Doshi said.It is worth mentioning that India is positioning itself as a lucrative option for global companies to establish their additional production base outside of China, keeping in mind its low-labor costs and business-friendly policies.Similarly, Nirav Doshi believes that India also has the potential to transition away from its reliance on China for warehouse automation solutions with more strategic investments and growing technologies.“Government initiatives, support for domestic manufacturing, improved infrastructure, and upskilling the workforce in technologies can incentivize the creation of indigenous automation solutions, reducing dependence on Chinese imports,” he added.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-15T13:52:30+05:30"},

Most of these companies are engaged in the trade of shoes or steel.The delays in issuing BIS certification to Vietnamese companies come at a time when Indian manufacturers, especially steelmakers, have raised concerns of increasing imports from the southeast Asian country.To be sure, manufacturers from other countries too are facing delays in securing BIS certification, especially Chinese companies. Although country-wise data wasn’t available, Vietnam accounts for the second highest number of applicants for BIS certification, after China, according to the officials mentioned earlier.India-Vietnam bilateral trade reached $14.70 billion in 2022-23, as per data from the Indian embassy in Hanoi. Of this, Vietnam’s exports to India were $8.8 billion, while about $5.9 billion worth of goods moved in the other direction.The Indian government has asked the Bureau of Indian Standards reasons for the delay in issuing certificates to the Vietnamese companies, the officials said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are not public.The 26 Vietnamese companies chiefly include manufacturers and traders of steel and footwear, and one company each in the polyester, tyres, chemicals, toys, batteries, and MDF plywood sectors. While about half the applications are for renewal of certification, the rest are for fresh certificates.The Vietnam embassy in New Delhi and the BIS did not respond to Mint’s queries.The quality barrierApplications for BIS certification have gone up following an increase in Quality Control Orders by New Delhi aimed at curbing substandard imports as well as boosting domestic production.The QCOs require Indian traders to produce BIS certificates of the manufacturing facility while importing goods, or face penalties.“Vietnam is becoming a major global supplier with whom even India has a trade deficit despite the large disparity in the size of the two economies,” said Bipin Sapra, indirect tax partner at EY. ;“Vietnam also benefits from India’s free trade agreement with Asean countries, so tariffs can’t be levied to balance the trade. In that scenario, QCOs are an effective non-tariff barrier that can be used for the benefit of the Indian industry to restrict at least the cheap and substandard quality imports,” Sapra added.Also read | More goods to come under quality control orders in Make-in-India stepQCOs are issued by different line ministries and standards of products are prepared by the Bureau of Indian Standards, an arm of the ministry of consumer affairs.The number of applicable QCOs has increased sharply in recent years—from 14 such orders covering 106 products in 2014 to 156 QCOs covering 672 products currently, India’s commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said in January.Recently issued QCOs include those for footwear, chemicals, toys, tyres, and synthetic fibers, apart from steel. The QCO for the footwear industry will be applicable from 1 August after multiple extensions.Also read | India issues quality orders on textiles to take on ChinaFear of Chinese steelIndia recorded a surge in steel imports to 8.3 million tonnes in 2023-24, surpassing the country’s exports of 7.5 million tonnes. A tenth of the steel imports came from Vietnam, making it the fourth-largest exporter of the alloy to India, behind South Korea, China and Japan.“Vietnam exported nearly 1 million tonnes of steel to India in FY24. Before that, exports were negligible,” said Dhruv Goel, the chief executive of market intelligence firm BigMint.Steel shipments from Vietnam to India, however, slowed after the steel ministry last year issued a Quality Control Order for Vietnamese steelmakers, effective October. Of the 26 Vietnamese companies seeking BIS certification, 10 deal in steel or stainless steel.When BIS issued certification to Vietnamese steelmaker Formosa Ha Tinh earlier this month, several Indian steelmakers raised concerns of a resurgence in imports from the country.Domestic steel manufacturers are also wary of Chinese companies using Vietnam and other countries for routing their products to India by leveraging New Delhi’s free trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations bloc, of which Vietnam is a member.India remains one of the few large economies globally with a growing appetite for steel, making the country an obvious destination for exports.Also read | Why Vietnamese steel makes Indian industry uneasy\"Vietnam has a high level of steel exports and there are very few avenues left for steel exporters in the global market besides India and to some extent the Middle East,” said Ranjan Dhar, director and vice president, sales and marketing, AM/NS India, a joint venture of ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.“So if the government doesn’t take safeguard measures like QCOs, imports from countries like Vietnam, China, etc., will surge at the expense of local manufacturers, who are heavily investing in expansion,” Dhar added. “Countries like China can also set up manufacturing sites in Vietnam to take advantage of the FTA with India.”China, with a billion tonnes of annual steelmaking capacity, accounts for more than half of the global steel production every year. But as China’s appetite for steel declines amid challenges in the domestic real estate sector, the country’s steel mills are left with surplus production. ;The result: Chinese mills have in recent months flooded global markets with steel, dragging down prices.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-28T10:39:46+05:30"},

Regular plywood with a thickness of 18mm is available for  ₹45 to  ₹52 a square foot, while the BWP version ranges from  ₹90 to  ₹100 a square foot.Queries emailed to spokespersons of consumer affairs ministry and BIS remained unanswered.Imports peak as exports fallKerala, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat are among the key plywood manufacturing hubs in India. Over the past few years, the industry has seen significant shifts in global trade. While plywood exports increased steadily from $32.28 million in FY19 to $75.26 million in FY23, they dropped to $57 million in FY24, suggesting a potential change in market conditions.Also read: An ISI okay for luxury labels: What’ll we think of next?In contrast, plywood imports were more volatile, hitting a peak of $132.43 million in FY23 after declining from $118.11 million in FY19, commerce ministry data showed. This fluctuation, coupled with the steady rise in exports, cause the plywood trade deficit to shoot up.“These trends highlight the challenges and opportunities in India’s plywood sector, indicating a need for strategic planning and market analysis to sustain growth and competitiveness in the global market,” said Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).", "Published_Date": "2024-06-07T15:00:18+05:30"},

In March America’s former president, and its EV-basher-in-chief, complained that they “cost too much” and “don’t go far”. Many car buyers seem to agree. In America deliveries of EVs have not risen in the past three quarters. In greener-than-thou Europe they fell last month, by 11% year on year. On April 23rd Tesla, a byword for the electric revolution, reported poor quarterly results, with falling sales and revenues. It has shed $330bn in stockmarket value since January 1st. Five ev wannabes, collectively worth close to $400bn in 2021, are valued at a mere $58bn today.Having raced to boost EV production, established carmakers are slamming on the brakes. Ford has delayed $12bn in planned EV investments. Mercedes-Benz now says it will reach its goal of selling as many EVs as petrol cars by 2030, five years later than originally promised. You may conclude that the electrified future is in peril.That would be much too gloomy. In fact there are good reasons to expect demand to pick up. The industry may well emerge from today’s dip on a more sustainable course towards carbon-free motoring. One reason for optimism is that the recent slowdown is partly cyclical. Sales grew rapidly in 2021 and 2022 as cash-rich consumers went on a post-pandemic spending spree. Many EVs that are not being bought now were purchased back then—as were lots of laptops, smartphones and other gizmos that are now languishing. Higher interest rates mean that Americans who paid less than 5% a year on a car loan two years ago now have to pay more than 8%. That is a problem, especially when in many places the typical EV remains 40-60% pricier than its petrol-powered alternative.Mr Trump may have a point on EVs’ cost today, but not for much longer—another reason to dismiss the gloom. The green premium is narrowing for many models. Prices of battery minerals such as lithium have fallen, as have prices of the cells they go into. Five years ago electric SUVs were two to three times the cost of their gas-guzzling cousins, without being two to three times as good. Today you can buy a Ford F-150 Lightning for less than $40,000, just $4,000 more than the petrol version of the popular pickup—$4,000 that you earn back in a single year by not having to fill it up with petrol (which, in contrast to lithium, is not getting cheaper). It is easier to juice up, too, at one of roughly 200,000 charging ports across America, twice the number available in 2020. In China electric cars are already the cheaper option on average, says the International Energy Agency, an official forecaster, even before running costs. Small EVs are two-thirds the price of a comparable fossil-fuel runaround. A new survey by AlixPartners, a consultancy, found that 97% of Chinese car buyers say their next car will run on batteries.Western carmakers may also draw lessons from the Chinese experience. Whereas early adopters bought a Tesla as a status symbol, the Chinese are now buying cars made by its rival, BYD, because they are good value. Western makers should fixate less on high-end models and stop neglecting the middle-of-the-road. Until they do, high prices will keep demand subdued and economies of scale elusive. Ford expects its pickup-obsessed electric division to lose at least $5bn this year.The fact that investors are becoming more discerning should help. They are no longer prepared to pour billions into any e-startup with a passable slide deck. And they are rewarding firms with mass-market ambitions. Tesla’s stock price plunged when it was reported earlier this month that Elon Musk would scrap a $25,000 car in favour of a fleet of self-driving robots. The share price bounced back on April 23rd, after he performed a u-turn. Shares in General Motors, whose bosses talked up its coming mass-market EVs on an earnings call this week, have gained 25% so far this year.Western governments worried about climate change and oil prices could do more to speed along the ev revolution, by giving Chinese carmakers more access to their markets. AlixPartners found that seven in ten Americans, Britons, French and Germans would consider an EV from China if it cost 20% less than a non-Chinese alternative—which is close to the real price difference.So far policymakers have focused on expanding charging capacity (which is welcome) and handing out subsidies (which is less so). They would do better to lift the barriers that keep Chinese EVs from their roads. That would please motorists and, by boosting competition, jolt incumbent carmakers into cleaning up their EV act.© 2024, The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.

Should you buy? | Mint", "Author": "Livemint", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/livemint", "Content": "OnePlus is all set to launch its Nord CE 4 Lite smartphone in India at an event on June 24. However, prior to that event, last year's OnePlus Nord 3 has now received a massive discount on Amazon which takes the price of smartphone to below  ₹20,000.OnePlus Nord 3 price in India:During the Amazon Monsoon Mobile Mania sale, the OnePlus Nord 3 with 8GB RAM/128GB storage is listed at a price of  ₹19,999. Moreover, the price goes down even further for users who can pay using Amazon Pay ICICI Bank or DBS Bank cards.To recap, the OnePlus Nord 3 was launched in July 2023 at a price of  ₹33,999. Now, with the discounted price, the Nord 3 may end up undercutting the recently launched Nord CE 4 and the upcoming Nord CE 4 Lite.OnePlus Nord 3 specifications:The OnePlus Nord 3 sports a 6.74-inch AMOLED display with a 1080p resolution and a refresh rate of 120Hz. The panel is capable of supporting HDR10+ and is safeguarded by Dragontrail glass for added protection.The mid-range smartphone is powered by the MediaTek's Dimensity 9000 chipset, coupled with a maximum of 16GB LPDDR5X RAM and up to 256GB UFS3.1 storage. The device runs on OxygenOS 13.1, built on the Android 13 platform and comes with promised 3 years of operating system updates and 4 years of security updates.The OnePlus Nord 3 is available in two color options: Tempest Gray and Misty Green. The Tempest Gray variant features a textured matte finish, while the Misty Green version has a slightly glossy appearance. The phone is constructed with a flat chassis made of Corning Gorilla Glass 5, and its outer frame is composed of plastic material. Notably, the Nord 3 includes convenient features such as an alert slider and an IR blaster. Additionally, the device is IP54 certified, providing a certain level of protection against dust and water.In terms of photography capabilities, the Nord 3 is equipped with a triple camera system consisting of a 50MP wide lens (Sony IMX890/OIS), an 8MP ultrawide lens, and a 2MP macro lens. On the front, there is a 16MP camera for capturing selfies and video calls.Should you buy OnePlus Nord 3 at  ₹19,999?The OnePlus Nord 3 was probably a bit overpriced at  ₹33,999, but with a price tag of under  ₹20,000, it's a must-buy. Although the Dimensity 9000 chipset that powers the Nord 3 is almost 3 years old, it is still better than most of the SoC's found under the  ₹25,000 price segment.In fact, the Nord 3 is more powerful than the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 that powers the Nord CE 4, which was launched just 2 months ago. With a reported Antutu score of over ten lakh, the Nord 3 comfortably beats its newly launched sibling, which can only manage scores in the eight lakh range.There are some other obvious advantages here too, including a glass sandwich design, a better camera, faster RAM and storage, and the presence of the alert slider (absent from the CE lineup). Beyond the OnePlus lineup, the Nord 3 at this price should be a compelling device for anyone looking to buy a smartphone for under  ₹25,000 right now.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-22T10:37:43+05:30"},

Moreover, users with access to Flipkart Axis Credit Card can also take advantage of a  ₹2,800 bank offer, which takes the effective price of the device down to  ₹53,199.

The smartphone is claimed to deliver a video playback time of up to 26 hours.However, with very limited time left for the release of the latest iPhone, the investment in an around 2 year old iPhone may not be wise. Notably, Apple introduced a number of AI features in iOS 18 via Apple Intelligence but all of these feature only work on iPhone 15 Pro variants. Meaning, that despite paying over  ₹50,000 for a smartphone you won't get any of the new AI features of iPhones. It would be wiser to save up some money and wait for the iPhone 16 launch, which will most likely come with all the advanced featues.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-22T13:27:26+05:30"},

Moreover, the concerns of the ongoing geopolitical tensions may adversely impact demand sentiments, especially for export-oriented sectors,” said Kinjal Shah, Senior Vice President &amp; Co-Group Head – Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited.The 5.0% YoY and 6.3% sequential revenue growth for Corporate India in Q4FY24 was supported by healthy demand in consumer-oriented sectors like airlines, hotels, automotive and FMCG. In addition, the growth in power and construction sectors was strong, Shah noted.Also Read: Why PSU banks are on a roll, explained in chartsHowever, the YoY revenue expansion was curtailed to an extent by a decline in realisation levels amid softening input costs (mainly raw materials), largely for sectors like fertilisers and chemicals, which also faced a demand slowdown due to channel inventory destocking.ICRA’s analysis of the Q4 results of 558 listed companies (excluding financial sector entities) revealed expectedly improved operating profit margins (OPM), increasing by 92 bps to 17.2% on a YoY basis. This was primarily aided by the softening in commodity prices and benefits of operating leverage. However, on a sequential basis, the OPM remained flat.The interest coverage ratio of ICRA’s sample set companies, adjusted for sectors with relatively low debt levels (IT, FMCG and pharma), improved marginally on a YoY basis to 4.9 times in Q4FY24 from 4.8 times in Q4FY23.Also Read: How to navigate stock market trends?

Capacity expansion being undertaken in ferrous and non-ferrous metals as well as the power sector drove debt addition in Q4FY24.Catch Stock Market Live Updates hereDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

Describing it as a \"heartwarming 25-minute watch,\" Gupta commended Federer's adeptness in delivering a masterclass despite his admitted discomfort with giving speeches. She noted how Federer's insights on tennis resonate deeply with both career and investment insights.Also Read | 3 lessons from Roger Federer’s speech at Dartmouth College: ‘Life is bigger than the court’ and moreGupta's key takeaways from Federer's speechGupta distilled three significant points from Federer’s address that she believes are crucial for personal and professional growth: “Three things that stood out for me…”1. Everybody can play well in the first two hours when they are fast, fit, and clear. It is when their body is tired, their mind wanders, and their discipline fades that champions find a grip on themselves. Resilience lasts for the long term.Also Read | Jim Rogers: I’ll invest in India again if the stock market goes down a lot2. Talent is not a gift but grit. It has a broad definition. Trusting yourself is talent. Patience is talent. Discipline is talent. The process is talent. Managing yourself is talent. In the investing world, too, all these are talents, more than picking funds and stocks.3. A legend won 80% of his matches but only 54% of his points. You don’t need to win more than that in life and investing. Champions don’t win every point; they realise they will lose points and learn how to deal with failure and learn from mistakes.Also Read | Canada’s Rogers profit takes hit from higher costs, media business weaknessBeyond the court and officeGupta concluded her reflection by emphasising Federer’s broader life lesson: the importance of happiness, using influence for good, and valuing time with family and friends. \"Never let happiness be decided by an NAV,\" she quoted, reminding her audience that life’s true value extends beyond professional achievements and financial metrics.What did Federer say?Federer began his speech with humour and humility. He acknowledged his lack of formal education but equated his tennis career to a significant life milestone. \"So I never went to college. But I did graduate recently. I graduated tennis,\" Federer said, capturing the attention of the 11,000-strong audience despite the rainy weather.Federer reflected on his career and the concept of retirement, expressing his distaste for the word \"retired.\" He explained, \"Like you, I’ve finished one big thing, and I’m moving on to the next.\"Effortless is a mythIn a candid moment, Federer shared how being labelled \"effortless\" often frustrated him, undermining the hard work and discipline behind his seemingly graceful play. Early in his career, he recounted a turning point when an opponent’s comment made him realise the importance of mental toughness over prolonged periods.\"Effortless is a myth. I mean it,\" Federer said. \"The truth is, I had to work very hard... to make it look easy.\"Federer’s anecdote about the Italian Open highlighted his journey from a talented but undisciplined player to a composed and strategic champion. His rivals’ critiques pushed him to improve, and he expressed gratitude for those challenging moments.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-12T11:48:12+05:30"},

It claims a hostile work environment with allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation, leading to the firing of eight former workers in 2022. The civil complaint, lodged in a Los Angeles court, claims the workers were terminated after they published an open letter expressing their concerns and urging SpaceX's board to distance itself from Musk.Elon Musk's Tesla insider trading lawsuit: Tesla shareholder Michael Perry has filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court in June 2024, accusing Musk of insider trading, another wire agency Reuters reported. Perry alleges that Musk sold over $7.5 billion of shares of the electric car maker in late 2022 before potentially disappointing production and delivery numbers were made public. The company's share price sank after Q4 numbers were made public on January 2, 2023, and Perry claimed that Musk \"improperly benefited\" by about $3 billion in insider profits. The lawsuit also accused Tesla's directors of breaching their fiduciary duty by allowing Musk to sell the shares.Elon Musk's pay package, Tesla move to Texas: Tesla Inc. shareholder Donald Ball has sued to challenge an upcoming proxy vote about whether the electric car maker should move its corporate home to Texas and re-approve a $56 billion pay package for Musk that was thrown out by a Delaware judge, Bloomberg reported in June 2024. Ball owns over 28,000 Tesla shares and argued that the company was violating its corporate charter by saying that it needed only a bare majority of shareholders’ votes in the June 13 proxy fight to move its state of incorporation away from Delaware. The shareholder has alleged that Musk is trying to force investors into voting for the Texas move and his resurrected pay package with threats about shifting artificial intelligence assets away from Tesla.Tesla Autopilot probe: In May 2024, Reuters reported that United States prosecutors are investigating whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicle (EV) self-driving capabilities. The report cited three sources that say the US Justice Department is scrutinising statements by Tesla and CEO Elon Musk that imply the cars can drive themselves. Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems assist with steering, braking, and lane changes, but they are not fully autonomous. The probe itself does not confirm wrongdoing and could lead to criminal charges, civil penalties, or no action.Lawsuit alleges Musk ‘secretly acquired’ Twitter stock: A shareholder lawsuit filed in May 2024 claims that Musk secretly acquired a major stake in Twitter in early 2022 before eventually buying it. It alleges that he did so with the help of a Morgan Stanley banker who advised the billionaire on how to avoid alerting the broader market. An Oklahoma public pension fund claims Musk’s delay in disclosing his ownership of more than 5% of the social media company artificially kept its share price down, as per a Bloomberg report. Musk was able to acquire more than 9% of Twitter without triggering a major stock price hike, which eventually happened once his ownership stake became public, according to the complaint.Elon Musk's use of recreational drugs: A shareholder lawsuit has claimed that Musk's illicit use of recreational drugs threatens Tesla’s business and influences his sometimes erratic behaviour online. This came after the Wall Street Journal in February reported that Musk often uses LSD, cocaine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms with Tesla board members at private parties. Then, in March 2024, Musk admitted to using the prescription ketamine and said that this is \"beneficial for investors\", adding that it helps him manage a \"negative chemical state\" similar to depression.In 2023...Tesla racism lawsuit: As many as 240 workers have filed a class action lawsuit alleging rampant racial discrimination at Tesla's California factory, AP reported in June 2023. They alleged facing frequent racial slurs from their co-workers and said the site was referred to as a \"slave ship\" by many. AP said as many as 6,000 workers who were contractors and employees at Tesla's Fremont factory between 2016 and the present are likely part of the class lawsuit. The testimonies were filed in Alameda County Superior Court in California. Notably, in April 2023, a federal jury awarded another former Tesla employee $3.2 million for racial abuse suffered.Lawsuit alleging insider trading by Elon Musk in Dogecoin: Investors filed a class action lawsuit against Musk in June 2023 for alleged insider trading and manipulation of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, which cost them billions of dollars. The investors have told the Manhattan federal court that Musk used Twitter posts, paid online influencers, and ‘publicity stunts’ on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" to trade profitably at their expense through several Dogecoin wallets that he or Tesla controls. They accused him of deliberately driving up Dogecoin's price by more than 36,000 per cent over two years and then letting it crash.Lawsuit claims Twitter owes ex-employees $500 million in severance: In 2023, former Twitter senior engineer Chris Woodfield filed a class action lawsuit claiming the company owes former workers at least $500 million in severance pay. He also alleged that Twitter targeted older workers for layoffs, though the complaint does not state his age. This is the third such lawsuit against the company after Elon Musk mass-fired staff following his takeover. In 2024, four former Twitter execs, including former CEO Parag Agarwal, sued Musk for $128 million in unpaid severance payments.Older...Tesla false advertising lawsuits: Bloomberg reported that Tesla faces numerous lawsuits claiming false advertisements to consumers, including inflating how far its EV drives on a charge and over-hyping its driving-assistance capabilities.JPMorgan sues Tesla: In November 2021, JPMorgan Chase sued Tesla for a series of stock warrant transactions impacted by Musk’s brief attempt to take the company private three years ago. JPMorgan is seeking a $162 million payout, claiming Tesla has shorted the bank what it’s due, as per a Bloomberg report. Musk's 2018 tweet claiming he would take Tesla private is central to the case.Elon Musk's Anti-Labour Union posts: A US Court ruled that Musk committed a series of violations of the National Labor Relations Act in 2017 and 2018 when he tweeted and threatened employees that they would lose their stock options if they formed a union. The US National Labor Relations Board called the tweet illegal and said it should be deleted. According to Bloomberg, a 17-judge panel is reviewing the board's findings, which would likely boost the morale of labour activists and Tesla workers.Musk accused of pushing Twitter price down: In May 2022, a Twitter investor, William Heresniak, filed a lawsuit accusing Musk of pushing down Twitter's stock price to either give himself an escape hatch from his $44 billion buyout bid or room to negotiate a discount. The suit alleges Musk of tweeting and making statements that created doubt about his takeover, which in turn roiled the social media platform's stocks for weeks. Musk negotiated his Twitter buyout in late April without carrying out due diligence expected in such megadeals, Heresniak alleged.Allegations of unpaid bills: X is facing multiple lawsuits for failing to pay landlords and vendors after Musk's takeover of Twitter. The suits alleged cost-cutting has led to non-payments and cited millions of dollars in unpaid expenses, Bloomberg reported.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-13T12:58:13+05:30"},

And that means that this problem of high pressure and extra heat when you shut down is completely solved. And so the complexity, that's meant that nuclear has gotten more complex and more expensive. As it's gone from first to third generation, we change that utterly.\"On fuel for the plant possibly coming from Russia, Gates said they delayed the plant for this reason, as the original plan changed. \"We've had to change the original plan, which would have gotten done in 2028, (but) was dependent on fuel fabrication in Russia. That's, of course, unacceptable now. And so all the fuel for these plants will come either from the United States or friendly countries,\" he added.On the politics and optics of nuclear power, post-Fukushima and amid Germany decommissioning similar plants, Gates sought to reassure. \"The inherent safety features in here are pretty amazing. You know, nuclear (power) actually has a pretty good track record despite the problems.\"\"This isn't a different regime, it doesn't require operators to do the right things. It just inherently, the heat fully gets absorbed with no release. So, you know, there are a lot of countries like France, the UK, Japan, and South Korea who are very accepting of nuclear; in fact, they know they need nuclear, but Japan's not as lucky as the US in terms of land for solar or wind. And so to go green, you know, it's got to be an even higher percentage nuclear in that case. And so working with those countries will show that we can get the costs down. And then I think even countries like Germany will look at this next generation and reconsider,\" he stated.Gates was also reminded of his wishes to find a source of energy with zero emissions and one that is cheaper than coal.\"(With) coal particularly you look at the health cost of the emissions (and) coal is being out-completed by natural gas. And so what we now have to do is compete effectively with natural gas. So once we get to our 10th unit, and we have our component cost down, we shouldn't expect people to buy electricity to pay higher prices. The risks should be these private investors and the US government. We believe we can meet that very aggressive cost target. And that's why we have the company and why we think it can not just in the US, but globally contribute to the climate challenge,\" Gates said.On his investments in nuclear energy, Gates said innovation can drive profitability. \"Well, amazingly, when a company succeeds in innovating, then it can be profitable. All these climate investments I've made. If we do succeed overall, that money goes to the Gates Foundation. So it allows us to do more on things like malaria and tuberculosis,\" he stated.Espousing similar sentiment on CBS's Face The Nation, Gates said he would \"put in billions more\" into next-gen nuclear energy. “I put in over a billion, and I’ll put in billions more.About TerraPowerA start-up founded by Gates, TerraPower LLC, broke ground last week to construct its first commercial reactor in Wyoming. This site was chosen after a coal plant was shut down.According to a Bloomberg report, TerraPower has been researching simpler and cheaper reactors since 2008. The plant has backing from the US Department of Energy and aims to complete the new reactor by 2030, it added.The report added that TerraPower plans to source reactor fuel from the US and its allies. The design includes using liquid sodium as a coolant instead of water and incorporating molten salt for heat storage to enhance output.(With inputs from Bloomberg)", "Published_Date": "2024-06-17T12:06:44+05:30"},

Low domestic demand in China is leading to substantial exports at prices below the cost of production,” Ranjan Dhar, director and vice-president, sales & marketing, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India), told Mint.According to a report by BigMint, export prices of hot-rolled coil coming from China have fallen to $520 per tonne from $525 per tonne within a week, leading to a continued pressure on global steel prices. In comparison, Indian export prices hovered in a range of $650-$660 ( ₹54,500- ₹55,000) per tonne, higher than China’s rates.Also read | Jindal’s ‘Steel of India’ campaign—whose idea is it anyway?China’s crude steel production rose 8.1% m-o-m to 92.86mt in May, from 85.94mt in April.

According to a steel ministry report, value of Chinese steel exports to India rose from $391.67 million in March to $434.01 million in April this year.Balancing Act Amid Global ChallengesAccording to provisional government data, India’s finished steel imports stood at 8.3mt in FY24, up 38%. China, South Korea, Japan and Vietnam were the major contributors, the Crisil’s report on the sector said.Weak global demand and falling input costs have weighed on steel prices. Coking coal prices fell 7% week-on-week to $239 per tonne FOB (free on board) on 21 June, according to BigMint.This has prompted Indian steel mills to focus on domestic demand, as exports remain a margin-dampening prospect. While competitive prices in West Asia and Southeast Asia remain a concern, the situation in Europe is deteriorating due to weak demand and a rigorous regulatory environment in play.Also read | Mint Explainer: Why Tata Steel is jittery about the UK election“Major competition for Indian steel exports is evident in the Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian markets, where China continues to flood the market with cheap exports, putting pressure on Indian mills.

The BSE and the NSE both run social stock exchanges.CSR AmendmentsCurrent CSR rules mandate companies to spend at least 2% of their average net profit over the last three years on any social welfare activities listed in the Companies Act, 2013. All organisations listed on SSEs operate in the same domains of social welfare mentioned in the Act, said Varshney.Currently, companies can donate to non-profit organisations outside of SSEs under their CSR activities. They cannot, however, fund non-profit organisations through SSEs to fulfil their CSR mandate. For this, an amendment in Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013, would be necessary. Schedule VII of the Companies Act lists the activities that companies undertake for CSR.Also read | CSR plans should be self-sustaining: MCASebi’s proposed amendments would allow companies to carry out their CSR activities by donating to social welfare organisations through SSEs, Varshney said. \"Not only retail investors, even the corporates will invest,\" he said. The minimum donation that can be made through SSEs is  ₹50 lakh, per a Sebi notice issued in December last year.SSE ImpactAs many as eight non-profit organisations are listed on the NSE SSE currently, an NSE spokesperson said. “The time is not far when donors will ask whether a non-profit organization is registered with a social stock exchange before moving funds,” said R Balasubramaniam, chairperson of Sebi’s special advisory committee on SSEs at the seminar. Representatives of the already-listed organisations who were at the seminar said they believed SSEs would have more than 100 listings by the end of FY25.\"This proposal is a welcome move and will help bolster the private philanthropy space and meet the deficit in India’s social sector spending,\" said Rashmi Birmole, a senior associate at Finsec Law Advisors, a securities law firm. \"SSEs will give credibility and visibility to social enterprises,\" she said.Also read | Mint Explainer: How Sebi wants to prevent insider trading violationsDonors can invest in Zero Coupon Zero Principal (ZCZP) securities issued by non-profit organisations, an innovative asset that will show up in a dematerialisation (demat) account but will not give monetary returns, as per Sebi. For-profit enterprises can raise funds using equity and debt instruments, like any other company listed on a stock exchange, a Sebi report said.Social Impact ReportingAll enterprises listed on an SSE need to file a social impact report, an accountability measure which will be audited by a company secretary, cost accountants, or chartered accountant. The report has to detail the activities of the organisation to donors. The first such report is expected to be published in December 2024, said Varshney. \"We have approached three bodies overseeing company secretaries, cost accountants, and chartered accountants to make an organization to assess social impact auditors and certify them with National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) certificate. NISM has started the course to empanel them,\" Varshney said.Also read | Sitharaman urges CAs to adopt carbon, CSR, ESG practicesOne of the key challenges for social welfare organisations may be the high cost of compliance. \"Not-for-profit organizations will have to engage in capacity building, because there is a lack of familiarity around innovative instruments like ZCZPs,\" said Birmole, the securities lawyer quoted earlier.For donors, it may be the lack of financial returns on investment or inadequate information before donating. \"There is no standard taxonomy or metric to assess or compare social impact,\" she said about donors’ woes.SSEs were introduced to provide information to willing donors to park their funds with legitimate institutions for charity. The principle of SSEs is to not provide financial returns, but instead focus on social returns - welfare of society, as per Sebi.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-14T19:34:25+05:30"},

While MPC revised the growth projection for FY25 upwards to 7.2% from 7% earlier, it is lower than the actual FY24 growth of 8%.Growth sacrifice?“Professional forecasters surveyed by the RBI are projecting growth both in 2025-26 and in 2024-25 to be lower than in 2023-24 by more than 0.75%, and lower than the potential growth rate (of say 8%) by more than 1%. This is an unacceptably high growth sacrifice considering that headline inflation is projected to be only about 0.5% above target, and core inflation is extremely benign,” said Varma.Also read | MPC meeting: Inflation elephant hogs attention; interest rate change unlikely“Expected growth is around 7% in 2024-25 below the 8% achieved in 2023-24. Status quoism is praised as being cautious. But if doing nothing distorts real variables, it aggravates shocks instead of smoothing them and raises risk,” Goyal added.Both Varma and Goyal had voted for cutting interest rate and changing monetary policy stance at the June meeting, the eighth time the committee has kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.5%.Sanguine about growthOn the contrary, other MPC members were sanguine about growth prospects. Governor Shaktikanta Das said economic growth is strong enough to create space for monetary policy to focus on inflation, which persists above its 4% target.“The growth-inflation balance is moving favourably in line with our projections,\" Das said. “With persistently high food inflation, it would be in order to continue with the disinflationary policy stance that we have adopted. Any hasty action in a different direction will cause more harm than good,” he said.Also read | When food inflation became main course on MPC menuIndia’s GDP grew at a blistering 8.2% in FY24, ably supported by January-March quarter growth of 7.8%. The push to GDP growth came from several key sectors including manufacturing, construction, mining and services sectors.‘Keep vigil’Michael Patra, RBI deputy governor in charge of monetary policy and other MPC members, backed intensifying monetary policy vigil over food inflation amid the current economic growth.\"With output in broad balance in relation to its potential, monetary policy can remain neutral to growth at this juncture and stay focused on aligning inflation to the target. That objective remains incomplete, which can undermine medium-term growth prospects,\" said Patra.Rajiv Ranjan, RBI executive director and MPC member said, “Let me emphasise - The inertia of inaction should not drive us to action. Rather, the driving force should be the macroeconomic setting of growth and inflation. Clearly, the favourable growth-inflation balance and the outlook is pointing towards status quo,” said Ranjan.Also read | Jayanth Varma, MPC’s sole dissenter, on inflation, interest rate and MSP“As the aggregate output projections for 2024-25 reflect strong GDP growth, keeping the monetary policy focus on achieving the inflation target on a durable basis is appropriate at this juncture,” said Shashank Bhide, MPC member.The moot point of disagreement between the doves and status quoists is the perception on anticipated growth conditions, said Vivek Kumar, an economist a QuantEco Research. \"As per the doves, India’s output gap will slip into negative territory in FY25 and FY26 if monetary policy is not finetuned as per the ongoing moderation in inflation. From the perspective of the status quoists, India’s growth prospects appear promising amidst the likelihood of a surplus monsoon outturn, improvement in global trade prospects, superior quality of fiscal consolidation, sound corporate balance sheets, and improvement in productivity,\" Kumar said.", "Published_Date": "2024-06-21T22:18:40+05:30"},

The result of Rivian retooling its manufacturing process is a 35% reduction in cost of materials for vans and savings of \"similar magnitude\" for its other lines, CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters.  Rivian's overall cost of building its EVs has \"improved dramatically,\" he told Reuters during a factory tour Friday at Normal, Illinois, 130 miles (209 km) south of Chicago. \"The design of the parts and the design of the plant facilitate making the vehicle easier to build.\"  Reuters got an exclusive look inside Rivian's four-million-square-foot factory, with investors eager to learn more about the size and pace of savings after a three-week shutdown in April.  Cutting cost is critical for Rivian and other EV startups as high interest rates have turned some potential customers off EVs that are typically more expensive to buy than their gasoline-powered counterparts. Rivian has never turned a quarterly net profit since it was founded in 2009 and lost $1.5 billion in the first quarter.  \"We did a similar process of really going through and redesigning a number of components for cost, so we took over 35% of the material cost out of the vans,\" Scaringe said, referring to a January shutdown of the van line.  Built primarily for major shareholder Amazon, Rivian's vans account for about one-fifth of its revenue.  Market leader Tesla has slashed prices but some smaller EV makers, including Fisker, have filed for bankruptcy.  Rivian is on more solid ground financially, but loses nearly $39,000 on every vehicle and is banking on cost savings to help it turn a gross profit this year.  WORK SMARTER  In addition to simplified assembly and less equipment at the plant, changes flow into the second generation of Rivian's R1 vehicles with company-built drive units, upgraded software and new battery packs.  Making those battery packs is now easier. The modules are redesigned and come in one piece instead of walls and floors that were built separately.  The vehicles also come with a new architecture meant to reduce weight and improve manufacturing efficiency, including shedding 1.6 miles of wiring from each vehicle.  Those changes have reduced labor time and pushed the rate of assembly on the manufacturing line up about 30%.  \"All of that together leads to us being able to get to our path to profitability and be gross-margin positive,\" said Tim Fallon, vice president of manufacturing at the plant.  But investors are worried. The plant shutdown meant Rivian is targeting production of 57,000 vehicles - almost the same as last year - and shares in the company have halved this year.  Cash and short-term investments fell by about $1.5 billion in the first quarter to just under $8 billion. Rivian had said it has enough capital to launch the less expensive and smaller R2 SUVs in early 2026.  Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions, who had expected the company to require a cash infusion before summer 2025, said reducing the cost per vehicle gives Rivian breathing room.  \"Focusing on where the cost savings are is extremely important to the longevity of the company and to calming the fears of any investors,\" he said.  To hasten R2 deliveries, Rivian said in March it would start producing its $45,000 five-seat SUV in its Illinois plant, which will be expanded, instead of at a planned $5-billion plant in Georgia. The move will save $2 billion.  R2 will account for 155,000 vehicles per year of the increased capacity of 215,000 in Normal, Fallon said. The factory currently has capacity of 150,000 vehicles.  \"We've really been able to understand what we need to do to continue to move forward and really be smarter about what we're doing,\" Fallon said.

Riot has withdrawn that $2.30-per-share offer because it believes Bitfarms needs boardroom changes to engage in good-faith negotiations, according to a statement Monday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report.&nbsp;  Bitfarms now has 21 days to set a date for the special meeting, in which its shareholders can vote on whether to remove the company’s chairman and interim CEO Nicolas Bonta and incumbent director Andrés Finkielsztain from the board, as well as any individual who fills the vacancy created by the departure of co-founder Emiliano Grodzki. Grodzki was voted off the board at Bitfarms’ most recent annual meeting.&nbsp;  “The bottom line is this: over the course of more than a year of attempting to engage constructively with the Bitfarms board regarding a potential combination of Bitfarms and Riot, it has become evident to Riot that good faith negotiations simply will not be possible until there is real change in the Bitfarms boardroom,” Riot said in the statement.&nbsp;  Riot has nominated three candidates for the Bitfarms board: John Delaney, the former mayor of Jacksonville, Florida; Ralph Goehring, a former energy company chief financial officer; and Amy Freedman, an adviser to Ewing Morris and the former CEO of Kingsdale Advisors, a shareholders services and advisory firm.  A representative for Bitfarms didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;  Riot has listed a range of corporate governance problems in Bitfarms, including high management turnover. Bitfarms fired interim CEO Geoffrey Morphy last month in the wake of the executive’s lawsuit against the miner claiming $27 million in damages for breach of contract.  Riot this month increased its stake in Bitfarms. That followed the smaller company instituting a so-called poison pill defense to fend off the offer, which it has said significantly undervalues the company and its growth prospects.  Bitfarms, which has said the Riot offer undervalues the company, has started a review of strategic alternatives and received “multiple unsolicited expressions of interest,” according to a statement this month.&nbsp;  The back-and-forth comes as consolidation in the crypto-mining sector ramps up. Large-scale Bitcoin mining companies flush with cash have been trying to accelerate their expansion by acquiring smaller rivals amid thinning profits. An April Bitcoin software update, called “the halving”, has dramatically reduced profit margins for the miners, resulting in about $10 billion in revenue losses a year.  Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process in which miners use specialized computers to validate encrypted transactions on the blockchain and earn a fixed amount of the token. The more computing power a miner has, the more likely it will receive the reward, spurring mining companies to scale up.  Riot has one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining farms in Texas with a total power capacity of 700 megawatts. It is also building another site in the state with as much as one-gigawatt capacity — enough to power 200,000 Texas homes.&nbsp;  (Corrects third paragraph to note that Grodzki departed, not resigned.)

The all-stock deal will give Australia’s Paladin operational control of one of the most advanced mining projects in western Canada’s Athabasca Basin, a remote area in Saskatchewan that’s loaded with high-grade uranium. Fission’s asset is expected to open in 2029 and produce an annual average of 9.1 million pounds of the metal over a decade.  “The rationale is very compelling,” Paladin Chief Executive Officer Ian Purdy said in a Monday interview. “We see this as a fantastic asset.”  Fission is one of several junior mining firms racing to develop projects in the Athabasca region, along with NexGen Energy Ltd. and Denison Mines Corp. The region has become a hub of mining activity as supply concerns escalate and while countries warm to nuclear power as part of a global push to move away from fossil fuels.  Fission CEO Ross McElroy said that while the region holds high concentrations of uranium, few companies have the expertise to find and develop such projects.  “Having worked the majority of my geology career in the Athabasca Basin, I can tell you that it takes a great deal of expertise to properly explore and make discoveries like this one,” he said in an interview.  Paladin’s CEO said he expects more uranium dealmaking on the horizon. The price of the radioactive metal has more than tripled during the past five years, accelerating after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a newfound need for alternative sources of the reactor fuel.  “Regardless of where the uranium cycle is or how the industry’s doing, the combination of these two companies just makes fundamental sense,” Purdy said.

The company now expects to hand over 770 aircraft this year, down from a previous goal of 800, it said in a surprise announcement after European markets closed on Monday. Speaking on a call with reporters, Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said the situation isn’t getting any better, requiring the company to adjust its goals.&nbsp;  Airbus has long warned of supply-chain issues and a lack of skilled workers, after the pandemic first grounded the global aviation industry and then left it unprepared once air travel came roaring back. Demand for its aircraft has been particularly strong in the last two years as airlines clamor for modern models, further exacerbating the shortfall in required equipment and labor.  The European planemaker now expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax of €5.5 billion ($5.9 billion) this year, down from a previous goal of as much as €7 billion. The company also cut its outlook for free cash flow before customer financing to about €3.5 billion. It pushed back its goal to produce 75 of its A320 single-aisle jets per month by one year to 2027.  The annual delivery revision is the second time since 2022 that Airbus has pared back that goal. The jet maker had most recently reiterated its 800-unit aspiration at the end of April when it reported numbers for the first quarter.&nbsp;  Compounding Airbus’s woes are issues afflicting the engines on its bestselling A320 model, which is powered by RTX Corp.’s Pratt &amp; Whitney model and the Leap variant made by the CFM International Inc. consortium. Faury said on the call that the situation has “significantly degraded” in recent weeks, and that the company will end up with gliders by the end of the quarter — industry parlance for planes without turbines.  Airbus has enjoyed a relatively calm first half of the year, while rival Boeing Co. has fallen into a deep crisis following a near-catastrophic accident on an airborne aircraft in early January. As a result, the US company has been forced to pare back output of its 737 plane, potentially giving Airbus an opening to win business from Boeing loyalists. At the same time, both companies are largely sold out on their bestselling products, giving Airbus only limited scope to capitalize on Boeing’s woes.&nbsp;  Airbus shares have gained about 7.1% this year, while Boeing has lost about 32% in value. American depositary receipts of Airbus fell 4.7% as of 1:54 p.m. in New York  The new forecast excludes any possible acquisitions, Airbus said. The company is nearing an agreement with Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. to take over parts of the aerospace supplier’s business, Bloomberg reported last week. Faury said discussions are continuing, but declined to comment on a possible conclusion of the talks.&nbsp;  “Spirit’s situation is difficult from an industrial standpoint,” Faury said. “It is part of the difficulties that are triggering this update.”  Airbus said it will also suffer charges of about €900 million related to some space programs, citing “complex and sophisticated products” that had caused development risks. As a result, Airbus will “evaluate all strategic options such as potential restructuring, cooperation models, portfolio review and M&amp;A options.”  The revision comes shortly before the end of Airbus’s second quarter. The Toulouse, France-based company is scheduled to report full half-year results on July 30.  (Updates with CEO comment in second paragraph.)

The Fed document doesn’t include an updated estimate on how much additional capital that large banks would have to hold as a cushion against financial shocks. But the people said early calculations suggest the proposed changes could lead to an increase as low as 5%. The original version called for an overall 16% hike.  Such a retreat would be a victory for Wall Street banks, which unleashed one of their fiercest lobbying campaigns after the proposal was unveiled last July. Substantial revisions to the plan are more likely to meet Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s goal of attracting broad support from the central bank’s board.  Two Republican-appointed Fed governors have said the initial version could raise the costs of lending, affect the economy and put US banks on weaker footing against international rivals.  Powell signaled earlier this year that the proposal was in for “broad and material changes.” Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, seen as the architect of the original plan, later said the same.&nbsp;  US officials haven’t yet reached an agreement, and it’s unclear whether they can get a revised package across the finish line before the US presidential election in November. Barr already has met with the heads of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to discuss lowering the capital hike, according to people familiar with the matter.  Key OCC and FDIC officials were open to walking back an important part of the proposal — known as market risk — but have indicated privately that they would resist any capital increase that they consider too low, some of the people said.  The Federal Reserve hasn’t made any decisions on timing, process or substance, a spokesman for the central bank said. The Fed isn’t targeting a specific range and is instead focused on the substance of possible revisions, he said.&nbsp;  The FDIC and OCC declined to comment.&nbsp;  Trading Business  The capital overhaul is tied to Basel III, an international accord that followed the 2008 financial crisis and is intended to prevent future bank failures and another crunch. Supporters of the US proposal have also billed it as a fix for some of the issues exposed by the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023.  Regulators are weighing changes to how the proposal assesses the level of risk tied to trading, wealth management and investment-banking activities — collectively known as market risk, according to some of the people familiar with the matter. Although Powell voted to propose the plan last July, he raised concerns about the “very large increase” in a measure used to determine capital requirements related to market risk.  This part of the plan might have a significant effect on banks with large trading businesses. In comment letters to regulators, industry officials have said the proposed rule would lead to “outsized increases” in market-risk capital and would discourage diversified trading-business models and certain hedging practices that allow banks to manage risk.  As they look at market risk, regulators are considering the way banks would use internal models to calculate risks linked to trading, according to some of the people familiar with the matter. The Fed document also includes recommended changes in the treatment of operational risk that would affect a broad range of banks, they said.&nbsp;  The European Union, which has watched the backlash against the US proposal with trepidation, plans to delay a key part of its capital rules by a year so its banks won’t be at a disadvantage. The EU had been set to implement the broad package on Jan. 1, 2025, but confirmed earlier this month that it will hold off for an extra 12 months on rules that affect banks’ trading activities.  Nonbank Competition  One criticism of the original version of the US plan is that it could put the country’s banks at a competitive disadvantage to nonbank lenders and overseas banks. The EU’s proposal would lead to about a 10% gain in Tier 1 capital requirements when fully implemented. The US increase of 16% is based on common equity Tier 1, or CET1, capital — the highest quality of regulatory capital covering liquid holdings like cash and stock. It represents the bulk of Tier 1 capital.  Under the plan proposed last July, the eight largest US banks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., could face an overall 19% jump in CET1 capital.  The proposal generally applies to banks with $100 billion or more in assets.  American officials have said that most US banks have enough capital to meet the higher requirements, which could be phased in starting in 2025 if approved. But for the largest banks, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that the draft rules could wipe out as much $155 billion in excess capital, the amount that goes beyond current regulatory requirements, and may lead to collective shortfalls.  Advocates for tougher rules say any shortfalls could be addressed if banks hung onto to more of their profits rather than using them to fund stock buybacks and pay higher dividends.  Banks say they are already well-capitalized to withstand a crisis and that the proposed changes would ultimately hurt consumers and small businesses. They pushed for major changes to the overhaul — or even scrapping the entire plan. In March, Powell didn’t rule out a complete redo.&nbsp;  The Fed and other regulators had been forging ahead with the proposal, and some officials had hoped to finalize it as soon as August.&nbsp;  Though officials were planning notable changes, US administrative law requires that they not veer too far from what was proposed. A decision to move ahead with a version based on the original plan could reduce the effect of a potential consolidation of power in November by Republicans, many of whom support the industry’s arguments.  Tossing out the plan and starting from scratch would be more likely to delay finalization until after the US elections. The Fed’s document doesn’t make any mention of a do-over, according to some of the people.  --With assistance from Laura Noonan and Nicholas Comfort.

In a fresh blow to its troubled space activities, Europe's largest aerospace group also announced fresh charges of around 900 million euros after its latest review.  \"We are facing headwinds right now; we have to bite the bullet,\" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told analysts.  The downward revision in industrial forecasts comes weeks after Reuters first reported Airbus faced new output delays as it grapples with increased parts shortages.  Industry sources said Airbus concluded it had exhausted its spare margin for deliveries after falling short of its internal target in the first five months, and then starting June at an insufficient delivery rate.  The aerospace industry has been struggling to rehire workers and stabilise supplies after the pandemic left many suppliers with weak finances.  Faury said supplies of engines for its best-selling A320-family of narrow-body jets had deteriorated \"significantly\" in recent months, one of several factors that prompted the planemaker to cut output forecasts.  The shortfall, he said, affects both engine suppliers for the A320neo narrow-body family, which competes with the Boeing 737 MAX accounts for most of Airbus' cash and profits.  Neither supplier - RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney and French-U.S. venture CFM International, co-owned by GE Aerospace and France's Safran - had any immediate comment.  Hinting at a tussle over penalties, Faury said engine suppliers would have to \"face the consequences\" of any delays.  SPIRIT AERO UNCERTAINTY  Faury also told reporters an uncertain outlook for the industrial commitments of aerostructures maker Spirit Aerosystems had contributed to the downward revision.  He declined to comment on the timing of a widely expected deal to acquire Spirit assets related to the A350 and A220 jet programmes as part of a carve-up of the supplier with Boeing , which sources have said they expect in days or weeks.  Spirit had no immediate comment.  Shortages of seats and cabin parts were also blamed. \"We continue to observe a very difficult situation on interiors,\" Faury told analysts.  Christian Scherer, who took over as head of the planemaking division in January, told German newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt in an interview published on Saturday that engines, landing gear and cabin components were contributing to tight supply chains.  In Canada, workers who produce components for some Airbus and Boeing landing gear at a Safran factory near Montreal have been striking for nearly four weeks.  In Toulouse on Saturday, a Reuters reporter identified five undelivered Airbus wide-bodied jets parked without engines.  Faury said engines for wide-bodied jets from Rolls-Royce are running behind schedule for the A330neo but not the A350. Industry sources said the fitting of some engines has been held back while Airbus awaits seats and other parts.

The blood test, called Galleri, can detect multiple types of cancer early and looks for 80% of the cancers that are currently not screened for, Grail CEO Bob Ragusa said in a telephone interview on Monday.  “The long game is to get that technology out with broad access around the world,\" said Ragusa, adding that that will come with regulatory approvals in the U.S. and elsewhere.  Ragusa estimates there are about 100 million people in the U.S. that are at elevated risk of being diagnosed with cancer, with another 90 million in the UK, 160 million across the EU and almost 50 million in Japan.  “It's really an enormous opportunity that we're looking at, and so we'll be doing the work to unlock that opportunity over the next couple of years,\" said Ragusa.  Galleri is a so-called lab-developed test and currently only sold in the U.S., with a test priced at $949.  The company promotes the test as a way of detecting cancers at an earlier stage, when it is more likely to be cured. The company is running two large clinical trials, including one in the UK, which it will use to submit for FDA approval in early 2026. U.S. approval could lead to broader adoption of its test.  However, some groups, including the American Cancer Society, want proof that Grail's test prevents cancer deaths, something Grail's studies are not powered to prove.  Grail currently has more than 100 commercial partnerships that span health systems, employers, and life insurance companies, Ragusa said.  During Illumina’s fight with antitrust authorities in U.S. and Europe, Grail initiated large-scale clinical trials, has delivered over 180,000 commercial tests, and scaled up its lab infrastructure, Ragusa added.  Illumina founded Grail and spun it off in 2016. Grail went on to raise funding from investors such as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. Illumina was left with a 12% stake, and decided in 2021 to acquire Grail to enter the cancer early-detection market.  The deal was opposed by antitrust regulators over concerns Illumina would stop Grail's rivals from accessing its technology to develop competing blood-based early cancer detection tests.  Illumina proceeded with the acquisition regardless, only to be slapped with a 432 million euro ($463.19 million) fine by the European Commision, which ordered the company to sell Grail.  In December, Illumina said it would divest Grail through either an outright sale to a buyer or by spinning it off.  As part of the spin-off, Illumina has provided Grail with funding to pursue its long-term strategy. Illumina will hold a minority stake of 14.5% in Grail, following the spin-off.

Around 28% of more than 56,000 workers surveyed by PwC said they were \"very or extremely likely\" to move from their current companies, compared to 19% in 2022, and 26% in 2023.  PwC's 2024 \"Hopes and Fears\" survey also showed workers are embracing emerging technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and prioritising upskilling amid rising workloads and heightened workplace uncertainty.  Pete Brown, global workforce leader at PwC UK, said employees are placing an \"increased premium\" on organisations that invest in their skills growth, and so, businesses must prioritise upskilling and employee experience.  About 45% of the workers surveyed said they have experienced rising workloads and an accelerating pace of workplace change in the last 12 months, with 62% saying they have seen more change at work in the past year than the previous 12 months.  Among employees who use GenAI daily, 82% said they expect it to increase their efficiency in the next 12 months.  Reflecting confidence that GenAI opportunities would support their career growth, nearly half of those surveyed by PwC expected GenAI to generate higher salaries, with almost two-thirds hoping these emerging tools will improve the quality of their work.  Carol Stubbings, global markets and tax and legal services leader at PwC UK, said employers must invest in staff and tech platforms to mitigate pressures and retain talent.  \"The findings suggest that job satisfaction is no longer enough,\" she said.

U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez will have a conference with attorneys for both sides Tuesday morning to determine final jury instructions. Gutierrez could also hear a motion from the NFL on Tuesday afternoon to grant judgment as a matter of law to the league because the plaintiffs did not provide enough evidence.  Gutierrez will then give final instructions to the jury of five men and three women Wednesday morning before final arguments begin. Each side will get 1 hour, 10 minutes to make their statements with the plaintiffs getting an additional 20 minutes for rebuttal.  The NFL's final witness was Stanford economics professor B. Douglas Bernheim, whose testimony began last Thursday and wrapped up Monday morning.  Bernheim reiterated the league's position that selling out-of-market Sunday afternoon games on Fox and CBS to DirecTV from 1994 to 2022 and now Google YouTube TV benefits the fan and creates level competition on the playing field.  Harvard professor Einer Elhauge, a rebuttal witness for the plaintiffs, contended there were no links between the restraints the league put in to make “Sunday Ticket” a premium package and creating competitive balance.  Elhauge also testified that the approximately $62.5 million each team gets per year from “Sunday Ticket” would not cause massive ramifications to the league's salary cap or a team's operating budget.  Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones testified last week that if he was able to sell his out-of-market rights, he would not be in favor of a salary cap.  The class action, which covers 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses who paid for the package of out-of-market games from the 2011 through 2022 seasons, claims the league broke antitrust laws by selling its package of Sunday games aired on CBS and Fox at an inflated price. The subscribers also say the league restricted competition by offering “Sunday Ticket” only on a satellite provider.  The NFL maintains it has the right to sell “Sunday Ticket” under its antitrust exemption for broadcasting. The plaintiffs say that only covers over-the-air broadcasts and not pay TV.  If the NFL is found liable, a jury could award $7 billion in damages, but that number could balloon to $21 billion because antitrust cases can triple damages.  The lawsuit was originally filed in 2015 by the Mucky Duck sports bar in San Francisco, but was dismissed in 2017. Two years later, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over California and eight other states, reinstated the case. Gutierrez ruled last year the case could proceed as a class action.  Whatever the decision ends up being, the losing side is expected to appeal to the 9th Circuit and then possibly the Supreme Court.  ___  AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl ", "Published_Date": "2024-06-25T05:31:32+05:30"},

However, installing the chips as Nvidia wanted could have affected Microsoft's ability to switch to different AI chips, the report added citing sources.The report said that disagreement over how Microsoft was using the hardware after its purchase led to the production of Nvidia's next flagship chip GB200 --- complete with a server rack design specified by Huang.The long-drawn argument only concluded when it reached Nadella's desk, and he reportedly made Nvidia roll back their demands. The report added that Huang's concern with server rack configuration stems from worry that companies such as Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS) will run out of data centre space.Nvidia vs Microsoft — Most ValuableNvidia slid for a third session on Monday (June 24), while the chip stocks index finished down 3.02 per cent, dampening investor sentiment toward artificial intelligence- and chip-related shares during Asian trading hours, as per a Reuters report.Notably, the stock has fallen 13 per cent since briefly overtaking Microsoft last week as the world’s most valuable company, Bloomberg reported.The semiconductor major has been battling Microsoft for poll position as the world's most valuable company for the last week.

The latest fracas involves the founder of the nutritional food brand Fit &amp; Flex, who has accused the channel of unfairly targeting it for trademark violations, The Indian Express reported.Pathik Patel, the founder of Fit &amp; Flex, has reportedly sent a legal notice to the channel, alleging that Sony Entertainment Television suspended its ad account without a just cause. In a LinkedIn post, Patel expressed his frustration, stating, “Feels really sad to see this, but wasn’t left with a choice either! It has been 50 days of zero D2C business and all we get to hear is ‘We won’t do anything’. We recently aired on Shark Tank S3 on the 15th of March which was a dream come true, but what followed has turned into a nightmare. Despite our joy at being featured on national television, our happiness was short-lived.\"Patel's alleged unfair targeting by Sony for trademark violationsfurther elaborated, “without any prior notice.” &nbsp;His post said: \"They have striked our social media posts containing clips from the Shark Tank episode and have gone ahead and blocked our Ad account, unpublished our Facebook page, and disabled the collaboration feature on our brand’s account as well as on my account\".&nbsp;\"Ideally we have aired in the episode, which we could use for marketing purposes for 3 months from the said date (as per their guidelines), but our content was pulled down within 25 days, after which we ceased to run all Shark Tank clips on organic as well as paid posts,\" Patel posted..Patel said Fit &amp; Flex continued efforts to resolve the issue without any success.“We have been writing to both Meta and Sony daily since, to help us with a solution, but haven’t received any resolution. We don’t want to use any clips for marketing and just want our original accounts back. All we want is someone from the SONY Team to talk to us and help solve this amicably but sadly not a single party (Sony Legal or Shark Tank) chose to reply. Not only me but more than 70 plus brands are facing these challenges. While we were shown a bigger picture of getting up to 5X &amp; 7X of growth, the Shark Tank experience has in fact got us a huge loss in business and a downfall of almost 10-12X.\"&nbsp;Patel expressed his disappointment as the founder of Fit and Flex, saying it was&nbsp;extremely disheartening to see that massive media houses are harassing startup brands.Despite not securing a deal on the show, Patel's experience with 'Shark Tank India' was challenging. He faced intense scrutiny from judges Deepinder Goyal and Anupam Mittal.&nbsp;Reflecting on the experience, he shared on LinkedIn, “But as they say….partial knowledge is always more dangerous than NO knowledge! A 15-minute edited video can only showcase that much and hence will use my platforms to debunk some popular myths!

So far, more than 53,000 verification requests have been executed successfully on this facility, said Central Board of Direct Taxes.CBDT on Sunday said that this functionality, which has been available as “Verification of applicability u/s 194N” on www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in since 1st July 2020, is also made available to the banks through web-services so that the entire process can be automated and be linked to the bank’s internal core banking solution.Explaining the details of this facility, CBDT said that now the bank/post office has to only enter the PAN of the person who is withdrawing cash for ascertaining the applicable rate of TDS. On entering PAN, a message will be instantly displayed on the departmental utility: “TDS is deductible at the rate of 2% if cash withdrawal exceeds  ₹1 crore” [if the person withdrawing cash is a filer of the income-tax return] and “TDS is deductible at the rate 2% if cash withdrawal exceeds  ₹20 lakh and at the rate of 5% if it exceeds  ₹1 Crore” [if the person withdrawing cash is a non-filer of the income-tax return].CBDT said that the data on cash withdrawal indicated that huge amount of cash is being withdrawn by the persons who have never filed income-tax returns. To ensure filing of return by these persons and to keep track on cash withdrawals by the non-filers, and to curb black money, the Finance Act, 2020 w.e.f. 1 July, 2020 further amended Income-tax Act to lower threshold of cash withdrawal to  ₹20 lakh for the applicability of this TDS for the non-filers and also mandated TDS at the higher rate of 5% on cash withdrawal exceeding Rs. 1 crore by the non-filers.It may be noted that in order to discourage cash transactions and move towards cashless economy, the Finance (No.2) Act, 2019 has inserted section 194N in the Income Tax Act w.e.f. 1 September, 2019 to provide for levy of TDS at 2% on cash withdrawal exceeding  ₹1 crore from a bank/post office account(s) subject to certain exceptions.", "Published_Date": "2020-07-12T20:36:02+05:30"},

It was originally announced earlier in October for central government employees alone.Under the scheme, employees can claim tax deduction on LTC by spending the money on buying goods and services instead of submitting travel bills.Though this may give you the flexibility to claim tax deduction on the money spent—equivalent to your LTC allowance—on goods and services, be ready to spend 7-14 times the sum saved as tax, according to back-of-the-envelope calculations.Also, not all spending will be eligible for the benefit. Spending on goods and services will be eligible for deduction only if they carry goods and services tax (GST) rate of not less than 12%. Such items include consumer goods items such as televisions and refrigerators, among others. Also, the goods and services have to be bought through digital mode and the employees should obtain the receipt indicating the GST number of the vendor and the amount of GST paid.Understand the mathAccording to government guidelines, employees will be able to claim a tax deduction equivalent to the LTC allowance up to Rs36,000 per person for a four-member family (Rs144,000 in total), provided the employees spend three times the LTC amount claimed as deduction on buying goods and services.Assuming a person can claim Rs144,000 as LTC and falls in the highest tax bracket of 42.74% (30% slab rate, including 37% surcharge and 4% cess on income more than Rs5 crore), he would save Rs61,551 in tax. However, in order to save Rs61,551 in tax, the person will have to spend Rs144,000x3 or Rs432,000, which is seven times the tax saved.Now let us take an example of a person earning Rs10 lakh-Rs50 lakh (surcharge is not applicable up to this limit). This person will have to spend in the range of 10 to 14 times of the tax saved, depending on the income level, to avail of the benefit under the scheme (see table).“However, the government has clarified that employees will be able to claim the tax deduction on a proportionate basis in case they spend a lesser amount. So, in case a person spends 50% of the required amount, he or she will be able to claim tax deduction on 50% amount, ” said Homi Mistry, partner, Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells LLP.Should you go for it?Experts said that those already planning to buy goods and services by 31 March, it’s a good option as they can claim LTC tax deduction against the money spent.“There are many products which attract GST of at least 12%. Therefore, employees planning to spend money on these goods and services will have the option to claim the LTC tax benefit as well,” said Mistry.However, experts caution against rushing to spend just for the sake of saving tax. “Private sector employees, unlike central government employees, who get LTC benefit over and above their CTC, have the option of getting the post-tax amount if they are not able to provide the bills. Therefore, it won’t make sense for them to spend three times the money just to save taxes,” said Melvin Joseph, a Sebi-registered investment adviser and founder of Finvin Financial Planners.“But for central government employees, it’s a good proposition as they wouldn’t have been able to claim the LTC benefit otherwise as travelling will be difficult in these times,” he added.Also, employees have the option to claim LTC in the first year of the next block. As per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, the exemption for LTC is allowed to an employee for two travels undertaken within a block of four calendar years. The block applicable for the current period is calendar years 2018 to 2021.“In case an employee is unable to claim LTC exemption twice in a block of four years, he can carry forward one journey to the next block. However, the carried forward LTC eligibility has to be utilized in the first year of the next block. For example, in case an employee has claimed LTC only once in the four-year calendar block of 2018 to 2021, he can claim LTC for travel undertaken in the first year of the next block, or in 2022. The employee can then claim two more journeys between 2023 and 2025. Also, the exemption is restricted for expense incurred on domestic travels only,” said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder and executive vice-president of TeamLease, a human resources company.“While any kind of choice has its advantages, one needs to wait and watch how individuals use this flexibility given the fact that they have the option of carrying forward this to the next block,” she added.Go for the scheme, if you are planning to buy goods and services in the prescribed time limit. Don’t overspend just to save taxes.", "Published_Date": "2020-11-02T12:16:36+05:30"},

Initially, it was compiled by taking an average of the rates quoted by a relatively small panel of banks each day.Though the submissions were supposed to reflect market conditions, the submitters were accused of gaming the system by quoting higher or lower rates to benefit specific trades as they were not expressly linked to actual trading.Following accusations of LIBOR rigging, almost $10 billion in fines were meted out across the financial industry. Meanwhile, that effort is crossing the finish line this week.“LIBOR was a ubiquitous rate across all global financial products; it was the single most important benchmark in the world, and to move the market away from that has been a truly herculean effort,” NYT quoted the head of US rates strategy at Bank of America Mark Cabana as saying.“There are still issues, but, remarkably, LIBOR will go out with more of a whimper than a bang. That was unthinkable years ago,” Cabana added.Unlike in Europe, the United States is replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, which represents the cost of borrowing for a broader variety of market participants. Also, it is based on actual transactions in overnight lending markets.In 2014, the US began the process to replace LIBOR but succeeded when the regulators in 2017 decided to replace LIBOR with SOFR.After this only, the process for transition to inform banks, fund managers, and others was underway, pushing them to shift contracts over to the new rate. So from 2022, new deals were not supposed to be linked to LIBOR, added the report.However, there are multiple contracts written before then, and after that still cite the LIBOR benchmark.According to JPMorgan Chase, around half the $1.4 trillion loan market, for example, has switched to paying interest pegged to SOFR. While the rest of the market has adopted language in loan documents that will take loans still tied to LIBOR and switch them to SOFR next week.As per co-head of policy at the Loan Syndications and Trading Association Meredith Coffey, who has been part of the transition effort since 2017, “It’s been a gargantuan amount of work.”Coffey said, \"When we started talking to people in cash markets telling them that LIBOR would cease, they thought we were crazy.\"Other data from the research firm Covenant Review says roughly 8 percent, or around $100 billion of the loan market has no fallback language.It adds that the loans are taken by riskier borrowers who struggled to refinance their debt to reference SOFR.According to analysts, companies may take advantage of a decision made this year by British regulators to publish a rate that mimics LIBOR through September 2024. The high rate is designed in a way to avoid any market disruptions after the deadline.Considering this also, a small number of companies may opt for the prime rate -- the cost for consumers to borrow from commercial banks -- which is a much higher rate than what banks charge one another.Ratings agency Fitch has warned that moving to the prime rate could have severe consequences as borrowers already buckling under the drastic increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve since 2022.Director at the investment firm KKR – Tal Reback, who is also a member of the industry committee managing the transition away from LIBOR opined that this has been a colossal change.“It’s been a re-engineering of global financial markets that came alongside a global pandemic, extreme inflation, and rising interest rates. There are going to be growing pains, but it’s time to say: ‘Rest in peace, LIBOR’,” he said.", "Published_Date": "2023-07-01T04:29:31+05:30"},

It is also costing many consumers money.By setting up automatic payments, or autopay, you authorize companies to pull money directly from your checking account to settle recurring bills. It has been a standard feature for fixed expenses, such as cable, for more than a decade and is becoming more popular for bills that fluctuate from month to month, like credit cards.The share of credit-card accounts enrolled in these automatic payments roughly doubled between 2015 and 2020 and continues to rise, according to data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and industry executives.In theory, higher autopay enrollment should lead to reduced credit-card fees since customers who sign up for automated payments are less likely to forget to pay and thus can avoid late fees and interest charges. Yet the total fees and interest paid by cardholders rose 19% to around $240 billion from 2015 to 2020, according to federal data.Consumers often wind up underpaying when they autopay, according to a study by Jialan Wang, associate professor of finance at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a former economist for the CFPB. Borrowers who use autopay pay off between 8% and 17% less of their monthly credit-card balances compared with customers who make manual payments, according to the study.Smaller payments then lead to paying more in interest, which might offset the benefit of avoiding late fees, especially as interest rates rise, she said.How it worksWhen credit-card customers sign up for autopay, they typically have three options for monthly payments: the required minimum, the statement balance in full or a custom amount. Most people who enroll in autopay choose either the minimum payment or full balance, said Wang.Those who pick “pay in full” when they set up their automatic payments are more likely to change their settings within the first 10 months since this option is less affordable in the long term, her 2022 study for the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests. Those who pick “minimum payment” tend to keep that setting.Pitfalls of autopayToday, more than three-quarters of people are using autopay for at least one bill, said Derek Swords, vice president of digital payments at Fiserv, a payments company. Automatic payments are becoming more popular because of their convenience, he said.Most consumers are more comfortable setting up recurring payments as subscription models are used for everything from streaming services and gym memberships to coffee and lingerie.“It’s a set-it-and-forget-it mindset,” Swords said.Banks like it too. Customers who are on automatic payments pose half the risk of customers with similar credit who aren’t on autopay, said Max Axler, chief credit officer at Synchrony Financial, which services more than 70 million credit-card accounts.“If I had my way, I’d have 100% of our population enrolled,” he said.Credit-card companies usually give customers who occasionally miss payments the benefit of the doubt and assume they simply forgot. Late payments typically aren’t reported to credit bureaus until they are more than 30 days late.Accounts that unenroll from autopay before their balance is paid in full or have multiple automatic payments returned for insufficient funds raise immediate red flags, said Axler.“It’s not uncommon for that person to go delinquent,” he said.While autopay enrollment has no direct impact on credit scores, being perceived as riskier by your bank could make it harder to get approved for more credit or lead to reduced credit limits, according to financial advisers.At Capital Services, a credit-card company that manages the card portfolios for a number of regional banks, 0.3% of autopay plans are terminated every month for insufficient fees.That churn rate isn’t high enough to raise alarm, but it is high enough to show that autopay isn’t viable for everyone, Sherry Tunender, senior vice president at Capital Services, wrote in a letter to the CFPB viewed by The Wall Street Journal.“Individuals who have enrolled in [autopay] but whose payments are getting returned should not have been enrolled in the first place,” she said.Pick your defaultsThe only surefire way to avoid fees and interest charges with autopay is to pay off your balance in full. But that only works for people with reliable income and steady spending habits. Overdraft fees can offset any savings from late fees if you spend more on your credit card than you have in your checking account.You can avoid overdrafts by scheduling your automatic payments on days you are paid instead of using the default statement date, Wang said.There is also value in paying your bill the old-school way, manually, according to financial advisers. Actively managing your account helps you stay on top of your spending and spot any fraudulent charges.“Autopay has not really changed very much for many years, and whether or not consumers use it, it’s not necessarily serving them that well,” said Wang.Write to Imani Moise at imani.moise@wsj.com", "Published_Date": "2023-10-08T18:09:15+05:30"},

These agri startups empower the nation's backbone—farmers, affectionately nicknamed Annadatas—by providing solutions tailored to address their issues comprehensively.Over the past nine years, the startups in agriculture and allied sectors have surged from 50 to 7,000 due to a favourable business climate and robust government support, according to a report titled 'Transformation of India's Agriculture' released by the Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA). In addition, the budget allocation for agriculture also saw a jump from  ₹30,000 crore to  ₹1.3 lakh crore.&nbsp;The central government has launched various policies, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY), Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) to extend financial support to farmers.&nbsp;Agripreneurs believe that Indian agriculture will transform the industry in the coming decade by shifting significantly towards sustainable practices like bio-based solutions and technological advancements like artificial intelligence, IoT, drones, etc.&nbsp;“In the next 10 years, the adoption of bio-based solutions like microbial products, biofertilizers, and biopesticides will increase, driven by the need for eco-friendly farming methods. This shift will improve crop productivity, soil health, and water conservation and reduce pesticide residues,” said Harsh Vardhan Bhagchandka, President of IPL Biologicals.&nbsp;“Precision agriculture technologies, such as AI, IoT, and drones, will be more integrated to optimize resource usage, improve yields, and minimize environmental impact. The agriculture industry is on the cusp of significant innovation, ready to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world,” he told LiveMint.&nbsp;Bhagchandka said IPL Biologicals builds partnerships with farmers and research institutions, develops digital platforms to support annadatas, invests in research and development, and advocates for sustainable agricultural policies to adapt to agri trends.&nbsp;He said the agri-startup addresses farmers' problems like declining soil health, disease and pest resistance, and overuse of synthetic chemicals, exacerbated by climate change with innovative, research-based microbial solutions that enhance crop yields, reduce chemical usage, and improve soil quality.&nbsp;When it comes to technology, one should not forget drones and artificial intelligence which gained significant traction in the agriculture sector. Drones and AI technology provide farmers with numerous advantages, such as enhanced efficiency, higher yields, and lower costs.&nbsp;The Government of India also launched the “Drone Didi Yojana” to train 15,000 women to operate drones for agricultural purposes and impart skills in technology.&nbsp;Pradeep Palelli, founder and CEO of Thanos Technology, said, “We envision a future where the majority of India's agricultural fields use drones in some manner—be it for Spraying Fertilizers or pesticides or for monitoring the field to take actionable insights.”The agri-tech company built agriculture-spraying drones with GPS technology and an Intelligent Flight Controller that enables autonomous spraying in the field, he said, adding that it saves farmers' money and eliminates health hazards as no human is present inside the farm during the process.&nbsp;“The manual spraying method takes an hour to cover around one acre of land, while the drones can cover around eight acres in the same period. It can reduce around 95% of water usage compared to conventional methods,\" Palelli told us.&nbsp;On the other hand, Kartheeswaran KK, CEO and co-founder of Ninjacart stated that agri-tech brands are harnessing AI tools to transform the agriculture landscape, offering innovative solutions to farmers.“This trend is evident in India, with the rise of agritech startups, highlighting a supportive environment for growth and development. We tackle challenges faced by farmers and input retailers with enhanced digital solutions in finance, market information, advisory, and business management,” he said.&nbsp;The agri-based company has introduced AI-enabled WhatsApp bots that provide instant advisory services, using a GenAI system trained on millions of data points to identify crop diseases and recommend remedies to illiterate farmers, he said.&nbsp;The Thanos Technology founder, whose family has roots in agriculture, expects that mechanization or automation — be it manned technology or unmanned devices like tractors, weeders, drones, etc. — will become more common in the coming years.&nbsp;“It is evident that manual labour availability is decreasing yearly in the agriculture sector due to labour migration to different cities and their shift to non-agricultural operations offering higher income. We expect more innovative business models to take shape in this industry, given the widespread acceptance of this technology,” he added.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-05-25T12:19:02+05:30"},

How startups shift to debt financing fuel business growth? | Company Business News", "Author": "Alka Jain", "Author_Url": "https://www.livemint.com/authors/alka-jain", "Content": "Securing the right funding is critical for startups to foster growth and achieve sustainability. Traditionally, equity financing has been the go-to option for many young businesses. However, amid a significant dip in equity fundraising, they are now turning to debt financing as a viable alternative to fuel their growth. This shift shows a better grasp of diverse financial strategies that support a startup’s growth without diluting ownership.Before diving deep into them, let us understand the difference between equity and debt financing. Equity financing involves raising capital by selling company shares, which dilutes ownership but doesn't require repayment, while debt financing entails borrowing money that must be repaid with interest without giving up ownership but adding financial liability to the company.‘Ownership control, strain cashflow’Debt funds have many advantages as founders can retain control of their decisions and future financial benefits, said Avishek Gupta, MD and CEO of Caspian Debt. Besides this, the overall cost is lower with fixed interest rates, flexible repayment schedule, and quicker to get access to debt funds, he told LiveMint.&nbsp;Gagan Aggarwal, CFO of Clix Capital, stated that founders can also reduce tax outgo since interest payments are business expenses. He said that easy budgeting due to monthly repayments and timely repayment of debt borrowings strengthen the bureau score, making it easier to take additional borrowings for growth and at better rates.&nbsp;However, the industry players noted that some risks and challenges are also associated with debt funds. “Excessive leverage can increase financial risk and strain cash flows. The situation of missing a debt payment can harm the company's creditworthiness and impede future financing options,” Gupta said.&nbsp;“Debt incurs interest, which must be paid regularly, even if your business is not making a profit. In a down-cycle, it may increase your financial stress. If repayments are not made in a timely manner, the credit score can be impacted, leading to higher borrowing costs in the future or even potentially restricting borrowing capability,” Aggarwal told us.&nbsp;‘Debt funds to equity fundraising ratio’Hence, experts suggested that startups should clearly understand their risk tolerance, cashflows, and growth trajectory to determine an appropriate balance between debt and equity financing for their business models. They said it is crucial for entrepreneurs to recognise their cashflow projections and other obligations to repay their debt on time.&nbsp;“A capable finance head is essential for startups. Outsourcing to a quality CA or CFO firm is an option if hiring isn't possible. When considering external debt funding, this role becomes as crucial as technology or marketing leads, helping forecast future cash flows and evaluate borrowing options suitable for growth stages,” Gupta recommended.&nbsp;On the other hand, the Clix Capital CFO asserted that it's crucial to minimize borrowing costs, as growth often requires substantial debt financing. “Lower costs can enhance profitability and overall company health. Comparing with peers helps businesses find the right balance of debt and equity for optimal growth and stability.”‘Bank loans, collateral loans’They further advocated for different types of debt financing for startups, including bank loans, term loans, working capital loans, loans against collateral from NBFCs, vendor financing or invoice financing, corporate bonds, debentures, and trade credits.&nbsp;“Banks offer the lowest-cost debt but may not suit startups without mortgage collateral. Often, startups get frustrated chasing bank loans. Instead, focus on lenders known for funding startups and meeting their criteria. Not every lender should be a target,” Gupta said.&nbsp;“Ideally, loans should go to companies with a profitability track record, repayment capability, and collateral. Startup lenders use proxies for these parameters, so data transparency is crucial. Mature startups may explore term loans or hybrid financing for growth, while early-stage startups often use venture debt, convertible notes, lines of credit, or asset-based loans for flexibility and favourable repayment terms,” he added.&nbsp;Early-stage MSMEs may find bank loans challenging and should consider term loans, working capital loans, or collateral loans from NBFCs, Aggarwal said, adding that vendor or invoice financing is also an option if they supply to large businesses. \"Mature MSMEs have more options, including bank loans, NBFC loans, corporate bonds, debentures, and trade credit.”‘Debts reliable source amid funding winter’&nbsp;Venture debt funds crossed the $1 billion mark in 2023, while equity fundraising, including private equity and venture capital investments, declined by about 35% to around USD 39 billion in 2023 from USD 62 billion in 2022, according to a joint report by Bain &amp; Company and IVCA released last month.&nbsp;Experts believe that debt financing can be a reliable option for entrepreneurs who want to scale their businesses amid funding winter. “In case of funding winter, where there are limited options available for equity investments, startups can resort to debt capital to help them scale,” said Gupta.&nbsp;“Startups can maintain their equity value by using debt to seize strategic opportunities and defer raising equity until it's more accessible. However, they must ensure they can repay the loan. In short, startups shouldn't resort to debt simply because equity isn't available; they should do so with a clear repayment plan in mind,” he added.&nbsp;The Clix Capital CFO stated that equity poses a risk of reduced investments due to an uncertain environment and heightened risk aversion among investors, which may delay the growth plans of startups and result in loss of business.&nbsp;“Debt financing is a faster and more reliable source of funding for businesses, which can help them grow their businesses without losing ownership of the business. It helps companies to leverage a small amount of money into a much larger sum, enabling more growth, which may otherwise be difficult. Hence, they should positively look at debt financing amid funding winter,” Aggarwal added.&nbsp;", "Published_Date": "2024-06-10T10:43:34+05:30"},

I have term insurance of  ₹60 lakh. I also have health insurance of a family floater of  ₹5 lakh covering me, my wife and our 3-year-old daughter). Now, I came to know about critical illness insurance. Which aspect should I take care of while purchasing critical illness insurance?Congratulations, at your age, you are well informed about insurance needs. First of all, since you are just 28 and have an annual income of  ₹6 lakh, ideally, you should have life insurance equal to anything between 15 times to 20 times to take care of the increase in your income and the steeper cost of buying life insurance later in life. Taking 15 times your annual income of  ₹6 lakh, you should have a minimum of RS 90 lakh of life insurance, whereas you have only 60 lakh insurance. So I would advise you to buy additional term insurance of  ₹30 lakh. Buy a term plan only, and if possible, buy an online term plan.Regarding your health insurance, a 5 lakh floater is inadequate, and I would advise you to buy a super top-up policy of Rs10 lakh with a deductible of  ₹5 lakh.For readers' benefit, let me explain why one needs to buy critical illness cover. Health insurance takes care of your expenses incurred on hospitalisation, and life insurance takes care of your family's financial needs in case you are not around. You need to cover a situation where you are diagnosed with a serious illness which incapacitates you from earning, and you are unable to engage in your regular earning activity actively. So, in such a situation, neither will the health insurance pay as it covers only the hospitalisation part, nor the life insurance company will not pay as you are still alive. So, critical illness insurance takes care of this need, where you get money on being diagnosed with certain specified critical illnesses.As far as critical illness coverage is concerned, though this can be bought as a rider with life insurance, the amount offered is insignificant compared to the amount of critical illness one needs to have, which is available only as a stand-alone policy. While buying a critical illness policy, ensure it covers a maximum number of critical illnesses specifically taking into account your family history of such illness. Buy critical illness minimum of your life insurance coverage as critical illness entails ceasing of income accompanied by increased expenses on medication not covered under health insurance.Balwant Jain is a tax and investment expert and can be reached at jainbalwant@gmail.com and on @jainbalwant on Twitter.", "Published_Date": "2024-04-30T09:55:38+05:30"},

She has some fixed deposits with a bank and had earned interest of  ₹3.30 lakh, which crossed the income tax exemption limit of  ₹3 lakh. So she deposited Rs.45,000 in the Senior Citizen Saving Scheme (SCSS) to avail of benefits under Section 80C. She had furnished a 15G form to the bank for no tax deduction at source. But the bank has deducted tax @ 20% on interest as she does not have PAN. The bank has advised us to file her ITR to claim the refund. Can the bank not accept 80C proof and not deduct tax? What should we do to get the amount back? She does not have a PAN card. Can she file the return without a PAN card?Answer: As per Section 206AA, since your mother does not have a PAN number, the bank must deduct tax @ 20% on the interest even if your mother has submitted form No 15G. Since your mother is a senior citizen, she must submit form No. 15H, not 15G.A senior citizen can submit form No. 15 H if the total tax on her income is nil. So, if there is no tax liability after considering the deduction under Section 80 C, your mother can submit form no. 15H. The bank cannot accept the proof under Section 80 C while deducting the TDS.To claim the tax refund already deducted by the bank, it is necessary to file her income tax return (ITR). Please note that your mother can not file her ITR because she does not have a PAN. Since your mother has no PAN, you must first apply for one. However, if she has an Aadhaar Number, it can be used instead of PAN. Please submit the same to the bank requesting to revise the submitted TDS return to mention PAN/Aadhaar number against her name. Unless the bank carries out this correction, your mother will not get credit for the tax deducted by the bank. Moreover, even if your mother submits from No. 15H, the bank will again deduct tax @ 20% on the interest unless she furnishes her PAN/Aadhaar.&nbsp;You don't need to file your income tax return because you have a PAN.Balwant Jain is a tax and investment expert and can be reached at jainbalwant@gmail.com and on @jainbalwant on Twitter.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-01T14:45:50+05:30"},

Whichever method one opts for declaring the income, the same has to be followed consistently year after year.Also Read | Income Tax return (ITR) filing 2024: What is Form 16, when is issue date and why is it crucial? — ExplainedFrom your question, it appears that, in the past, you have been offering the interest income in the year in which the same was credited to your savings bank account. So you have followed the receipt basis for providing your income for tax in the past, which you are supposed to follow this year as well. So, declare the interest credited in your savings bank account for the year while filing your ITR.Please note that your bank would deduct tax on interest on an accrual basis, and there may be some mismatch between the interest income offered by you for the year and the interest on which tax is deducted by the bank during the year. For those who have large-value fixed deposits with banks, it is advisable to offer the interest income from such bank fixed deposits on an accrual basis so that there is no sudden spurt in your income in the year in which the fixed deposit matures, as well as no need to carry forward the amount of TDS from one year to another year.Balwant Jain is a tax and investment expert and can be reached at jainbalwant@gmail.com and on @jainbalwant on Twitter.", "Published_Date": "2024-05-11T13:08:03+05:30"},

This, indeed, can be a burden, particularly for older individuals. While premiums can rise significantly year after year, the cost of healthcare itself is also climbing.

Here’s how you can manage:Read more: Diversifying investment style is crucial: FundsIndia’s Arun Kumar&nbsp;• Establish a dedicated fund for premiums: Consider creating a dedicated fund specifically to cover future health insurance premiums. This makes budgeting for premiums more manageable, especially since health insurance is typically cheaper than out-of-pocket hospital bills.• Maintain a backup fund: Health insurance might not cover everything, like routine doctor visits, etc. Creating a separate savings fund for these extra costs is essential, especially as we age, and our healthcare needs often increase.• Explore super top-up plans: Consider buying a ‘super top-up’ plan alongside your base plan. Super top-up plans typically have lower premiums and only kick in after you’ve reached a certain threshold (deductible). So, even if the base plan becomes expensive over time, the super top-up may remain more affordable. Let’s say you have a base plan that covers up to  ₹10 lakh and a super top-up that covers anything above  ₹10 lakh. If most of your claims are under  ₹10 lakh, the premium for the super top-up will remain low. And if the base plan’s premium gets really high, you could even drop it and keep the super top-up for major expenses. Sure, paying  ₹10 lakh out of pocket might not be ideal, but this is like a worst-case scenario plan—it’s better to pay a lower premium now than risk not being able to afford a hospital bill later.Read more: Why this 24-year-old trusted a fee-only adviser for financial guidance&nbsp;When it’s time to renew a health insurance policy, is it necessary to disclose any new illnesses, ailments or surgeries experienced within the last 12 months since the previous renewal?—Name withheld on request.This is a common question most people have regarding health insurance renewal.Well, you generally don’t need to disclose new medical conditions during health insurance renewal if the condition arose after your policy was initially issued.
